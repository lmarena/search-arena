0,The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice此书中有关于人际交往脚本理论的内容吗，如果有是如何进行阐述的呢,"根据搜索结果，特别是对《The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice》（第二版）的目录和内容的描述，似乎没有专门章节或明确标题直接阐述“人际交往脚本理论”（Interpersonal Script Theory）。

该手册内容广泛，采取跨学科的方法，涵盖了与说服相关的众多领域。其内容结构从微观到宏观，包括认知过程、个体、说服理论，以及更广泛的社会因素，如社会背景和大规模说服活动。

手册中涉及的理论和主题包括：
*   修辞传统中的说服
*   信息特征：内容、结构和风格
*   媒体影响作为说服
*   说服的结果：行为、认知和社会层面
*   信念改变的差异模型
*   功能性态度理论
*   理性行动理论：作为基于信念的行为改变的说服
*   精化可能性模型 (Elaboration Likelihood Model, ELM)
*   情感与说服
*   抗拒理论与说服 (Reactance Theory)
*   恐惧诉求 (Fear Appeals)
*   叙事说服 (Narrative Persuasion)
*   预防接种理论 (Inoculation Theory)
*   说服在政治、健康宣传、法律、小团体等情境中的应用

虽然该手册提到了人际沟通研究者会感兴趣的问题，并且讨论了诸如信息特征、认知过程、社会背景等可能与人际交往脚本间接相关的元素，但在可查阅的目录和描述中，并没有明确列出“人际交往脚本理论”作为一个独立的理论进行阐述。

需要注意的是，“脚本”（script）这个词在其他理论中也有使用，例如沟通分析心理学中的“人生脚本”（life script），它指的是一种被预先决定的生活模式，但这与社会心理学中关于特定社交情境下预期行为序列的“人际交往脚本理论”有所不同。

**总结来说**：基于现有信息，《The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice》似乎并未专门或详细地阐述“人际交往脚本理论”。它更侧重于其他主流的说服理论和模型及其在不同领域的应用。如果该书有涉及，可能是在讨论人际影响、信息处理或特定情境下的说服策略时有所提及，但并非作为一个核心理论来介绍。",search
1,The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice此书中有关于人际交往脚本理论的内容吗，如果有是如何进行阐述的呢,"好的，关于《The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice》这本书是否包含“人际交往脚本理论”（Interpersonal Script Theory）以及如何阐述，我们可以进行如下分析：

**可能性分析:**

1.  **高相关性:** 人际交往脚本理论与说服紧密相关。脚本（Scripts）是指人们在特定情境下（如请求帮助、销售、约会、道歉等）存储在记忆中的、预先建立的、按时间顺序排列的行为序列和期望。说服过程常常发生在这些有脚本的情境中。
2.  **说服中的应用:**
    *   **自动反应/思维捷径:** 脚本理论的一个核心观点是，人们在熟悉的情境中常常依赖脚本进行“无意识”（mindless）或自动化的行为，而不是深入思考。这与说服理论中的“启发式处理”或“边缘路径处理”（如ELM模型）相关。说服者可以利用对方的脚本来更轻松地获得依从（Compliance）。例如，Ellen Langer著名的复印机实验就表明，只要给出符合请求脚本形式的理由（即使理由本身不充分，如“因为我要复印”），也能提高依从率。
    *   **依从性获得策略（Compliance-Gaining Strategies）:** 许多说服和依从性获得策略的设计，实际上是在尝试激活、利用或甚至打破对方的特定脚本。例如，“脚在门槛内”（Foot-in-the-Door）策略可能通过先获得一个小请求的同意，激活了对方“乐于助人”或“保持一致”的脚本，从而增加后续更大请求的成功率。
    *   **脚本冲突与说服抵抗:** 当说服信息或请求与接收者预期的脚本严重不符时，可能会引起警惕、负面情绪，从而导致说服抵抗。
    *   **特定情境下的说服:** 在销售、谈判、医患沟通等特定的人际交往情境中，脚本扮演着重要角色。理解这些情境下的脚本，对于设计有效的说服策略至关重要。

**在《SAGE Handbook of Persuasion》中可能的阐述方式:**

虽然我无法直接访问该书的最新版本来确认具体章节和页码，但根据此类手册的编纂惯例和说服领域的研究范畴，**极有可能**在书中**涉及到**与人际交往脚本理论相关的概念，即使不一定有一个标题直接命名为“Interpersonal Script Theory”的独立章节。

它更可能以下列方式被整合和阐述：

1.  **在讨论认知过程与说服的章节中:** 可能会在讨论**自动性（Automaticity）、启发式处理（Heuristic Processing）、无意识（Mindlessness）**或**认知捷径（Cognitive Shortcuts）**时，引入脚本或图式（Schemas）作为解释人们为何有时不经深思熟虑就接受说服信息的机制。会引用Langer等人的经典研究。
2.  **在讨论依从性获得（Compliance-Gaining）策略的章节中:** 在分析各种具体的说服技巧（如FITD, DITF, ""That's-not-all""等）时，可能会解释这些技巧如何作用于人们的心理脚本或期望。
3.  **在讨论社会影响（Social Influence）基础理论的章节中:** 脚本可能作为更广泛的社会规范、角色期望和社会认知结构的一部分被提及，说明这些结构如何引导行为并影响对说服信息的反应。
4.  **在讨论特定情境下说服（Persuasion in Specific Contexts）的章节中:** 例如，在关于**销售说服、健康沟通、组织沟通**等的章节里，可能会分析这些特定场景下的典型交往脚本，以及说服者如何利用或适应这些脚本来达到目的。
5.  **在讨论说服抵抗（Resistance to Persuasion）的章节中:** 可能提及当说服尝试**违反了接收者的脚本预期**时，会如何触发防御机制。

**总结:**

*   《The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion》**非常有可能**在其广泛的内容中触及或整合了人际交往脚本理论的核心概念。
*   它可能不会设立一个独立的“脚本理论”章节，而是将其作为解释**自动认知过程、依从性获得策略、社会影响机制以及特定情境下说服现象**的一个重要理论视角或概念工具来阐述。
*   阐述的重点会放在脚本如何影响人们对说服信息的**处理方式（自动vs.审慎）**、如何**指导行为反应**，以及说服者如何**利用或应对**这些预设的脚本。

**建议:**

如果你能接触到这本书，最好的方法是查阅书的**索引（Index）**，查找关键词如 ""scripts"", ""social scripts"", ""automaticity"", ""mindlessness"", ""compliance gaining"", ""schemas"", ""heuristics"" 等。同时，浏览**目录（Table of Contents）**中涉及认知过程、社会影响、依从性策略和特定沟通情境的章节，很可能会找到相关论述。",non-search
2,what are the capitals that people tend to get wrong,"It's quite common for people to mistakenly identify a country's (or even a state's) capital city, often assuming the largest, most famous, or economically significant city holds that title. Here are some of the capitals that people frequently get wrong:

**Commonly Confused National Capitals:**

1.  **Australia:** The capital is **Canberra**. Many people incorrectly assume it's Sydney or Melbourne, which are larger and better-known internationally. Canberra was actually chosen as a compromise between the two rival cities.
2.  **Canada:** The capital is **Ottawa**. Toronto (Canada's largest city), Vancouver, and Montreal are often mistakenly named as the capital due to their size and prominence.
3.  **Brazil:** The capital is **Brasília**. Rio de Janeiro, famous for its landmarks and beaches, or São Paulo, the largest city in the Southern Hemisphere, are frequently mistaken for the capital. Brasília was purpose-built as the capital starting in the 1950s and officially inaugurated in 1960.
4.  **United States:** The capital is **Washington, D.C.** New York City, being the largest city and a global financial hub, is a common incorrect guess. Washington D.C. was specifically established to serve as the nation's capital.
5.  **Turkey:** The capital is **Ankara**. Istanbul, a historic and transcontinental city, is often thought to be the capital due to its size and cultural significance. Ankara became the capital in 1923.
6.  **Switzerland:** The capital (or ""Federal City"") is **Bern**. Zurich (a major financial center) and Geneva (home to international organizations) are often incorrectly identified as the capital. Bern is actually the fifth-largest city in Switzerland.
7.  **New Zealand:** The capital is **Wellington**. Auckland, the largest and most populous city, is frequently assumed to be the capital.
8.  **South Africa:** This is tricky because South Africa has **three capitals**: **Pretoria** (executive), **Cape Town** (legislative), and **Bloemfontein** (judicial). Johannesburg, the largest city, is often mistakenly named.
9.  **Morocco:** The capital is **Rabat**. Casablanca (famous from the film) or Marrakesh (a major tourist destination) are common incorrect answers.
10. **Nigeria:** The capital is **Abuja**. Lagos, the largest city and former capital (until 1991), is often mistaken for the current capital.
11. **Bolivia:** Bolivia also has **two capitals**: **Sucre** (constitutional and judicial) and **La Paz** (seat of government - executive and legislative branches). La Paz is more commonly mistaken as the sole capital.
12. **United Arab Emirates (UAE):** The capital is **Abu Dhabi**. Dubai, known for its rapid development and tourism, is often incorrectly assumed to be the capital.
13. **Myanmar (Burma):** The capital is **Naypyidaw**. Yangon (formerly Rangoon), the largest city and former capital (until 2006), is still often thought to be the capital.
14. **Pakistan:** The capital is **Islamabad**. Karachi, the largest city and former capital (until 1958), is a common misconception.
15. **Vietnam:** The capital is **Hanoi.** Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), the largest city, is sometimes mistaken as the capital.

**Why the Confusion?**

*   **Largest City vs. Capital:** The most common reason for error is assuming a country's largest, most populous, or most economically important city is its capital.
*   **Historical Capitals:** Some cities were capitals in the past (like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, Istanbul/Constantinople, Philadelphia, Karachi, Yangon) but the capital later moved.
*   **Purpose-Built Capitals:** Many current capitals (like Canberra, Brasília, Washington D.C., Ottawa, Abuja, Naypyidaw, Islamabad) were specifically planned and built to serve as administrative centers, often in more neutral or central locations.
*   **Multiple Capitals:** Countries like South Africa and Bolivia officially divide capital functions among multiple cities, leading to confusion.
*   **Prominence and Tourism:** Cities that are major tourist destinations or frequently in the news (like Sydney, New York, Rio, Istanbul, Toronto, Dubai, Geneva) are often assumed to be capitals.

This pattern also extends to subnational divisions, like US states, where cities like Los Angeles (California - capital is Sacramento), Chicago (Illinois - capital is Springfield), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania - capital is Harrisburg), or Detroit (Michigan - capital is Lansing) are often mistaken for state capitals.",search
3,what are the capitals that people tend to get wrong,"Okay, this is a great question because it taps into a very common phenomenon: people often assume a country's largest, most famous, or economically important city is its capital.

Here are some of the national capitals that people frequently get wrong, often confusing them with larger or more prominent cities:

1.  **Australia:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Canberra
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Sydney or Melbourne (Sydney is larger and iconic; Melbourne is culturally significant and a former capital).

2.  **Brazil:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Brasília
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo (Rio is world-famous and the former capital; São Paulo is the largest city and economic powerhouse). Brasília is a purpose-built capital.

3.  **Canada:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Ottawa
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Toronto, Montreal, or Vancouver (Toronto is the largest city; Montreal is the largest French-speaking city; Vancouver is prominent on the west coast).

4.  **Switzerland:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Bern
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Zurich or Geneva (Zurich is the financial center and largest city; Geneva hosts many international organizations). Switzerland technically has no *de jure* capital, but Bern is the *de facto* seat of the federal authorities.

5.  **Turkey:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Ankara
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Istanbul (Istanbul is the largest city, straddles Europe and Asia, and was the capital of the Ottoman Empire).

6.  **United States:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Washington, D.C.
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** New York City (While less common among adults familiar with the US, globally or among younger learners, NYC's status as the largest city and cultural/financial hub can cause confusion).

7.  **South Africa:**
    *   **Actual Capitals:** Pretoria (administrative), Cape Town (legislative), Bloemfontein (judicial)
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Johannesburg (Largest city and economic hub) or solely Cape Town (most famous tourist destination). The multiple capitals system is inherently confusing.

8.  **New Zealand:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Wellington
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Auckland (Largest and most populous city, former capital).

9.  **Myanmar (Burma):**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Naypyidaw
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Yangon (Rangoon) (Largest city and the former capital until 2005). Naypyidaw is a relatively new, planned capital.

10. **Morocco:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Rabat
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Casablanca (Largest city, economic hub, and famous from the movie) or Marrakesh (major tourist destination).

11. **Vietnam:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Hanoi
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) (Largest city and economic center, capital of former South Vietnam).

12. **Nigeria:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Abuja
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Lagos (Largest city, major port, economic hub, and former capital). Abuja became the planned capital in 1991.

13. **Bolivia:**
    *   **Actual Capitals:** Sucre (constitutional/judicial), La Paz (seat of government - executive/legislative)
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** Just La Paz (as it's where most government functions happen and is better known internationally). The dual-capital situation causes confusion.

14. **Netherlands:**
    *   **Actual Capital:** Amsterdam (Constitutional capital)
    *   **Often Mistaken For:** The Hague (Seat of government, home to international courts like the ICJ and ICC). People might assume The Hague is the sole capital due to its governmental and international role.

The main takeaway is that the capital isn't always the city you hear about most! It's often chosen for political, historical, or geographical reasons rather than size or fame.",non-search
4,Gillig low floor bus,"The Gillig Low Floor is a popular transit bus manufactured by the American company Gillig since 1997. Here's an overview of this model:

**History and Development:**

*   **Origins:** The design originated in the mid-1990s when Hertz Corporation sought a low-floor shuttle bus for airports to better accommodate passengers with luggage or limited mobility. This resulted in the Gillig H2000LF, which entered production in 1996.
*   **Transit Adaptation:** In 1997, Gillig adapted the H2000LF design for the transit market, renaming it the Gillig Low Floor. Key changes included replacing the single central door with dual entry doors.
*   **Market Position:** It was the second low-floor bus introduced in the United States, following the New Flyer Low Floor.
*   **Successor to Phantom:** Initially sold alongside Gillig's high-floor Phantom model, the Low Floor eventually replaced it entirely as low-floor designs became the standard. Since 2008, the Low Floor platform has been Gillig's sole vehicle platform.

**Key Features:**

*   **Low-Floor Design:** As the name suggests, its primary feature is a low floor (about 14 inches off the ground) and low-step entry, making boarding easier for all passengers, especially those using wheelchairs or mobility devices. It typically features an integrated manual or power wheelchair ramp.
*   **Accessibility:** Meets ADA requirements with features like wheelchair positions and securement systems.
*   **Construction:** Features a stainless steel chassis and an aluminum body for durability and lighter weight compared to its predecessor, the Phantom.
*   **Lengths:** Available in several nominal lengths, commonly 29 ft, 35 ft, and 40 ft.
*   **Styling:** The standard Low Floor has a classic, durable design. Over time, updated styling options were introduced.

**Variants and Options:**

*   **Gillig BRT (Bus Rapid Transit):** Introduced in 2005, this version features restyled, more modern front and rear fascias and projector headlights.
*   **Gillig Low Floor Plus:** Introduced in 2017, it combines elements of the standard Low Floor body with updated lighting and a smoother roofline transition, similar to the BRT Plus. All battery-electric models use this styling.
*   **Gillig BRT Plus:** Introduced around 2011, it features the BRT styling with a full-length roof fairing, initially designed to house CNG tanks or hybrid equipment.
*   **Gillig Trolley Replica:** Added in 2005, this variant mimics the appearance of a vintage trolley while using the modern Low Floor platform. It often includes features like wood seating and trim, brass handrails, and pull-cord stop requests.
*   **Suburban Commuter:** Offers enhanced passenger comfort features like reclining seats, luggage racks, and power outlets for longer routes.

**Powertrain Options:**

*   **Diesel:** Historically offered with engines from Cummins, Detroit Diesel, and Caterpillar. Current models typically use Cummins B6.7 or L9 diesel engines.
*   **Diesel-Electric Hybrid:** Available since 2004, using systems from Allison, BAE, and Voith, identifiable by roof-mounted battery packs.
*   **Compressed Natural Gas (CNG):** Available since Gillig partnered with Enviromech in 2010, typically using Cummins L9N engines. CNG tanks are often housed in roof fairings (BRT Plus/Low Floor Plus).
*   **Battery Electric:** Introduced in 2019 (using the Low Floor Plus body style), initially developed with Cummins. Newer versions (from 2023) use Akasol battery systems offering capacities up to 686 kWh and various charging options (plug-in, pantograph, induction).
*   **Trolleybus:** Developed in partnership with Kiepe Electric for Dayton RTA, these buses use overhead wires but also feature batteries for off-wire operation (""in-motion charging"").
*   **Hydrogen Fuel Cell:** Announced in April 2024 for production starting in 2026, developed with BAE Systems and Ballard Power Systems.

The Gillig Low Floor platform is known for its durability, reliability, and relatively lower total cost of ownership, making it a mainstay in numerous North American transit fleets.",search
5,Gillig low floor bus,"Okay, let's talk about the **Gillig Low Floor bus**. It's one of the most common and recognizable transit buses in North America, particularly in the United States.

Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

1.  **Manufacturer:** Gillig LLC, based in Livermore, California. They are one of the oldest continuously operating transportation manufacturers in the US and focus primarily on heavy-duty transit buses.

2.  **""Low Floor"" Design:** This is the defining characteristic. Unlike older ""high floor"" buses that required passengers to climb several steps, the low floor design features:
    *   **Easy Boarding:** Minimal or no steps at the front and middle doors.
    *   **Accessibility:** Greatly improved access for passengers using wheelchairs, walkers, strollers, or those with limited mobility.
    *   **Ramp:** Typically equipped with a deployable ramp (usually at the front door) for wheelchair boarding.
    *   **Kneeling Feature:** The bus can lower its front suspension pneumatically (""kneel"") to further reduce the step height at the curb.

3.  **Models & Variants:**
    *   **Gillig Low Floor (Standard):** This has been their flagship model for decades, available in various lengths (commonly 29 ft, 35 ft, and 40 ft).
    *   **Gillig Low Floor Plus:** An updated version featuring revised styling (especially front and rear caps), updated interior options, and potentially newer technology integration.
    *   **Gillig Battery Electric Bus:** Their fully electric offering, built on the proven Low Floor platform.

4.  **Powertrain Options:** Gillig has offered the Low Floor bus with a variety of powertrains over the years to meet different agency needs and environmental regulations:
    *   **Clean Diesel:** Still a common option, utilizing modern emissions control systems.
    *   **Compressed Natural Gas (CNG):** A popular alternative fuel choice for many transit agencies.
    *   **Diesel-Electric Hybrid:** Combines a diesel engine with an electric drive system for improved fuel economy and reduced emissions.
    *   **Battery Electric (BEV):** Zero tailpipe emissions, powered entirely by batteries.
    *   **Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric (FCEV):** Uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity onboard, offering zero emissions and longer range/quicker refueling compared to some BEVs.

5.  **Key Features & Reputation:**
    *   **Durability & Reliability:** Gillig buses are known for their robust construction and long service life, often built with stainless steel frames.
    *   **Customization:** Transit agencies can specify numerous options for seating arrangements, door configurations, HVAC systems, destination signs, fare collection systems, etc.
    *   **Widely Used:** Found in countless city, county, and regional transit fleets across the USA. Less common in Canada, where manufacturers like New Flyer and Nova Bus dominate.
    *   **Proven Platform:** The basic Low Floor design has been refined over many years, making it a familiar and trusted choice for operators.

In summary, the Gillig Low Floor is a workhorse of the American public transit system, valued for its accessibility, reliability, and the variety of configurations and powertrain options available. When you see a sturdy, somewhat boxy-looking city bus in the US with easy step-free boarding, there's a very good chance it's a Gillig Low Floor.",non-search

8,What are marked expecting for next fed and RBA meetings,"Okay, let's break down the market expectations for the upcoming meetings of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), keeping in mind that these expectations are fluid and based on current data and market pricing.

**Federal Reserve (Fed / FOMC - Federal Open Market Committee)**

*   **Next Meeting:** July 30-31, 2024
*   **Current Fed Funds Rate Range:** 5.25% - 5.50%
*   **Market Expectation (Overwhelming): Hold**
    *   The market is pricing in an extremely high probability (well over 90%, often closer to 95-100% depending on the day's data) that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at this meeting.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **Inflation Moderating, But Still High:** While inflation has shown signs of cooling (especially recent CPI reports), it remains above the Fed's 2% target. Fed officials, including Chair Powell, have repeatedly stressed the need for greater ""confidence"" that inflation is sustainably moving towards target before cutting rates.
    *   **Strong Labor Market:** The US labor market, while showing some very slight signs of cooling, remains relatively robust. This gives the Fed room to hold rates higher for longer without immediately fearing a sharp economic downturn.
    *   **Data Dependency:** The Fed remains data-dependent. They want to see several more months of encouraging inflation data before acting. One or two good reports aren't enough yet.
    *   **Recent Fed Signals:** The latest FOMC projections (""dot plot"") from the June meeting indicated fewer rate cuts expected in 2024 than previously anticipated (median projection shifted from three cuts to just one). Commentary has emphasized patience.
*   **Focus Beyond July:** The real market focus is on *when* the first cut might occur. September is currently seen as a possibility (around 50-65% chance often priced in, but highly variable), with subsequent meetings in November and December also in play. Expectations shift daily based on incoming economic data (especially PCE inflation - the Fed's preferred measure - and jobs reports).

**Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)**

*   **Next Meeting:** August 5-6, 2024
*   **Current Cash Rate Target:** 4.35%
*   **Market Expectation (Most Likely): Hold**
    *   The market assigns the highest probability to the RBA keeping the cash rate on hold at 4.35%.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **Sticky Inflation:** This is the dominant factor. Recent monthly and quarterly CPI readings have shown inflation is proving persistent and remains stubbornly above the RBA's 2-3% target band. The Q2 CPI data (released late July) will be absolutely critical for this meeting.
    *   **Hawkish RBA Tone:** At their last meeting (June), the RBA explicitly stated they discussed the option of *raising* interest rates, although they ultimately decided to hold. Governor Bullock's commentary has remained vigilant on inflation, emphasizing they will do ""what is necessary"" to bring it back to target.
    *   **Labor Market Still Tight:** While showing some signs of easing, the Australian labor market remains relatively tight by historical standards, which contributes to wage pressures and inflation concerns.
    *   **Weak Economic Growth:** This complicates the picture. The economy is very weak, and consumer spending is sluggish under the weight of higher rates and cost-of-living pressures. However, the RBA's primary mandate is inflation control.
*   **Possibility of a Hike?** While a hold is the base case, the persistent inflation data and the RBA's recent hawkish commentary mean a rate *hike* cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if the upcoming Q2 CPI data is surprisingly strong. Market pricing usually reflects a small, non-trivial chance of a hike (e.g., perhaps 10-25% probability, depending on the day and recent data).
*   **Rate Cuts Far Off:** Unlike the Fed, the market is generally not pricing in RBA rate cuts until well into 2025. The focus in Australia is still very much on whether the peak rate has been reached or if more tightening might be needed.

**In Summary:**

*   **Fed:** Almost certain **hold** in July. Market focus is on whether the first cut comes in September, later in 2024, or even 2025.
*   **RBA:** Most likely a **hold** in August, but driven by stubbornly high inflation. A rate hike remains an outside possibility, and rate cuts seem much further away than for the Fed.

**Important Caveat:** These expectations are based on market pricing (like Fed Funds Futures and OIS swaps) and current analysis. They can change rapidly based on new economic data releases (especially inflation and employment) or unexpected geopolitical events before the meetings occur.",non-search
9,What are marked expecting for next fed and RBA meetings,"Based on the latest information and market indicators available up to April 21, 2025:

**Federal Reserve (Fed / FOMC)**

*   **Next Meeting Date:** The next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is scheduled for **May 6-7, 2025**. The policy decision will be announced on May 7th.
*   **Market Expectations:** The overwhelming market expectation is that the Fed will **hold the federal funds rate steady** at its current target range (likely 4.25%-4.50%, based on recent reports).
    *   Futures markets, like those tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool, indicated a high probability (around 79% as of mid-April) of a pause at the May meeting.
    *   While rate cuts are generally expected later in 2025 (potentially starting in June or later in the second half of the year), recent Fed commentary and mixed economic signals (including inflation concerns possibly heightened by trade policy uncertainty) suggest a cautious approach in the near term.
    *   Fed officials have indicated a need to assess more data before making further moves, emphasizing that they don't need to rush adjustments. Projections from March suggested potentially two 0.25% cuts later in the year.

**Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)**

*   **Next Meeting Date:** The next RBA Monetary Policy Board meeting is scheduled for **May 19-20, 2025**. The decision will be announced on May 20th.
*   **Market Expectations:** Markets are pricing in a significant probability of an **interest rate cut** at the May meeting.
    *   The ASX 30 Day Interbank Cash Rate Futures contract for May 2025 indicated around a **62% expectation** (as of April 17th) of a 0.25% cut, which would take the cash rate from 4.10% to 3.85% (or 3.60% based on some search results - note the current official rate is likely 4.10% after a cut earlier in the year).
    *   Some major Australian banks (like CBA and Westpac) also forecast a 25 basis point cut in May, citing factors like the deteriorating global outlook and expectations for domestic inflation and labor market data.
    *   However, recent RBA commentary (including from Assistant Governor Sarah Hunter in March and minutes from the April meeting) has been cautious, emphasizing data dependence and downplaying the certainty of near-term cuts. RBA Governor Bullock has also resisted signaling imminent cuts, citing market volatility.

**In Summary:**

*   Markets strongly expect the **Fed to hold rates steady** at its upcoming May meeting, adopting a cautious stance amid economic uncertainties.
*   Markets are leaning towards an **RBA rate cut** at its May meeting, although RBA officials have recently sounded more cautious, making it less of a certainty than market pricing might suggest.

*Please note that market expectations can change rapidly based on incoming economic data, global events, and statements from central bank officials.*",search
10,"20 самых престижных турниров по коротким нардам в мире и их призовой фонд, разделённым по участникам?","Найти точный, ранжированный список 20 самых престижных турниров по коротким нардам с актуальными данными о призовых фондах и их точным распределением по участникам довольно сложно. Престижность турнира определяется многими факторами (история, сила участников, размер призовых), а призовые фонды и их структура меняются из года в год, зависят от количества участников, спонсорских взносов (""added money"") и вступительных взносов игроков.

Тем не менее, можно выделить ряд крупнейших и наиболее известных международных турниров, которые традиционно считаются самыми престижными и собирают сильнейших игроков мира:

**Наиболее известные и престижные турниры по коротким нардам:**

1.  **Чемпионат мира по нардам (Backgammon World Championship) в Монте-Карло:** Считается самым престижным титулом. Призовой фонд формируется из взносов участников и может достигать значительных сумм. Например, в прошлые годы победитель получал около €60,000-€100,000, а общий фонд зависел от числа игроков.
2.  **Merit International Backgammon Open (Северный Кипр):** Известен очень крупными призовыми фондами благодаря значительным добавленным средствам от организаторов (""added money""). Общие призовые фонды здесь регулярно исчисляются сотнями тысяч евро. Например, на турнирах Merit Open призовые фонды достигали €200,000 - €300,000 и более.
3.  **Nordic Open:** Один из старейших и крупнейших турниров в Европе, проводится в Дании. Собирает большое количество участников и имеет солидный призовой фонд, формируемый в основном из взносов.
4.  **USBGF National Championships (США):** Главный турнир, организуемый Федерацией Нард США (USBGF). Имеет несколько дивизионов и значительные призовые.
5.  **Las Vegas Open:** Крупный турнир, проводимый в Лас-Вегасе, привлекающий сильных игроков со всего мира.
6.  **Japanese Open:** Главный турнир в Японии, где нарды очень популярны.
7.  **New York Metropolitan Open:** Один из старейших и престижных турниров в США.
8.  **Турниры BMAB (Backgammon Masters Awarding Body):** Серия турниров в разных странах (например, США, Япония, Европа), имеющих высокий статус и привлекающих профессионалов.
9.  **Крупные европейские турниры:**
    *   **Gibraltar Backgammon Championship**
    *   **German Open**
    *   **French Open**
    *   **Italian Open**
    *   **UK Open**
    *   **Austrian Open**
    *   **Georgian Open (Тбилиси):** Быстро набирающий популярность турнир с хорошими призовыми.

**Призовые фонды и их распределение:**

*   **Формирование фонда:** Призовой фонд обычно состоит из суммы вступительных взносов всех участников плюс ""добавленные деньги"" (added money) от спонсоров или организаторов. В турнирах вроде Merit Open добавленные деньги могут составлять очень существенную часть фонда.
*   **Распределение:** Точная структура выплат (payout structure) публикуется организаторами перед каждым турниром и зависит от количества участников. Обычно призы получают:
    *   Победитель основного турнира (Main): Самый крупный приз.
    *   Финалист основного турнира.
    *   Полуфиналисты и четвертьфиналисты.
    *   Иногда призы получают игроки, занявшие места ниже (например, топ 8, топ 16 или даже топ 32, если участников очень много). Как правило, призы получают верхние 10-20% участников основного турнира.
    *   Победители и финалисты утешительных турниров (Consolation, Last Chance).
    *   Победители и призеры различных побочных турниров (Side Events), таких как Doubles (парный турнир), Speedgammon (быстрые нарды), турниры для новичков и т.д. Эти турниры имеют свои отдельные, обычно меньшие, призовые фонды.

**Примеры (ориентировочные):**

*   На **Чемпионате Мира в Монте-Карло** победитель может получить около €60,000, финалист - €30,000, полуфиналисты по €15,000 и так далее, при общем фонде, зависящем от числа участников (часто 150-200+).
*   На **Merit Open** с добавленными €100,000+ призовой фонд может превышать €300,000. Победитель может получить €70,000-€100,000+, финалист €35,000-€50,000+, и значительные суммы получают игроки до 16-го или 32-го места.

**Важно:** Чтобы получить точную информацию о призовом фонде и его распределении для конкретного турнира, нужно смотреть регламент этого турнира за соответствующий год на его официальном сайте или на сайтах новостей о нардах (например, Chicago Point, Backgammon Galaxy, или сайты национальных федераций). Информация о 20 турнирах с точным распределением призов за прошлые годы в одном месте обычно не публикуется.",search
11,"20 самых престижных турниров по коротким нардам в мире и их призовой фонд, разделённым по участникам?","Определение ""самых престижных"" турниров по нардам может быть субъективным и зависит от критериев (история, сила поля, размер призового фонда, статус чемпионата мира/континента). Кроме того, информация о призовых фондах и их *точном* распределении по участникам меняется из года в год и зависит от:

1.  **Количества участников** в каждом дивизионе (Open/Championship, Intermediate, Masters, Super Jackpot и т.д.).

14,"“Describe the
characteristics of the Second Industrial Revolution in the US, providing specific
examples. Be sure to discuss changes in the structure of firms, how the transformation
occurred, and how widespread these changes were.” ","The Second Industrial Revolution in the United States, generally dated from around 1870 to 1914, was a period of profound technological advancement, economic expansion, and societal transformation. It built upon the foundations of the First Industrial Revolution but was characterized by new technologies, new energy sources, and significant changes in business organization.

**Characteristics and Specific Examples:**

*   **Technological Innovation:** This era saw rapid scientific discovery and the introduction of transformative technologies. Key inventions included the telephone (1876), the light bulb (1879), the phonograph (1877), the internal combustion engine (1886), the automobile (1886), and the airplane (1903). Advances like the Bessemer and open-hearth processes revolutionized steel production, making it cheaper and more abundant. Steel replaced iron in railroads and allowed for the construction of skyscrapers using structural steel and elevators.
*   **New Energy Sources:** While the First Industrial Revolution relied heavily on water and steam power (using coal), the Second Industrial Revolution saw the widespread adoption of electricity and petroleum. Electricity powered factories more efficiently and reliably than coal, enabling longer working hours through electric lighting and leading to innovations like electric motors and trams. Petroleum became crucial with the invention of the internal combustion engine and advances in extraction and refining.
*   **Mass Production and Standardization:** Building on concepts like interchangeable parts (developed earlier, particularly in the arms industry), the Second Industrial Revolution perfected mass production techniques. Henry Ford's assembly line, introduced for the Ford Model T (1908), became emblematic of this shift, drastically increasing production speed and lowering costs. This required standardization of parts and processes. Frederick W. Taylor's ""scientific management"" (Taylorism) sought to maximize industrial efficiency by breaking down tasks and analyzing workflows.
*   **Expansion of Transportation and Communication:** Railroad networks expanded dramatically, integrating the nation into a single market economy. Steel rails were stronger and safer, and innovations like automatic signals and air brakes improved efficiency. Railroads facilitated the movement of raw materials, finished goods, and people on an unprecedented scale. The telegraph network, often built alongside railroads, enabled near-instant communication across vast distances, followed by the telephone, further shrinking geographical barriers.
*   **Growth of Key Industries:** Steel, chemicals, petroleum, and electricity became dominant industries. Large-scale steel production fueled railroad construction and urbanization. The chemical industry developed synthetic dyes and materials like plastics. The oil industry boomed, providing fuel and lubricants. Electrical companies like General Electric (founded 1892) brought light and power to cities and factories.

**Changes in Firm Structure:**

*   **Rise of Large Corporations:** The era witnessed the emergence of massive corporations, far larger than previously seen. Companies like Carnegie Steel (later U.S. Steel, the first billion-dollar corporation), Standard Oil, Ford Motor Company, and General Electric came to dominate their respective industries.
*   **Economies of Scale:** New technologies and production methods created significant economies of scale. Larger factories could produce goods much more cheaply per unit. This drove consolidation as larger firms bought out smaller competitors or forced them out of business.
*   **Vertical and Horizontal Integration:** Companies pursued strategies to control markets. Vertical integration involved controlling all phases of production, from raw materials to distribution (e.g., Carnegie Steel). Horizontal integration involved acquiring competitors to gain market dominance (e.g., Standard Oil's consolidation of refineries).
*   **New Management Structures:** Operating these large-scale enterprises required new forms of organization. Corporate bureaucracies emerged with specialized managers to oversee different functions (production, marketing, finance), mediating between owners and workers. Modern business management techniques developed during this period.

**Transformation Process:**

*   **Synergy:** Technologies and industries fed off each other. Cheaper steel enabled more railroads, which consumed steel and coal and transported goods cheaply, stimulating further industrial growth. Railroads and telegraphs expanded together. Electricity enabled new factory designs and machinery.
*   **Capital Investment:** The scale of new industries required vast sums of capital, leading to the growth of financial markets and investment banking (e.g., J.P. Morgan's role in financing railroads and consolidating steel).
*   **Labor Supply:** Industrialization was fueled by a large labor force, swelled by migration from rural areas within the U.S. and mass immigration from Europe and elsewhere. Between 1870 and 1920, millions moved from farms to cities, and millions more arrived from overseas.
*   **Government Role:** While often associated with laissez-faire policies, government support through land grants for railroads, tariffs protecting domestic industries, and legal frameworks supporting corporations played a role.

**Widespread Nature of Changes:**

*   **Economic Dominance:** The transformation was profound. By 1913, the U.S. produced one-third of the world's industrial output, surpassing Britain, Germany, and France combined.
*   **Urbanization:** The shift from an agrarian society to an industrial one accelerated urbanization. By 1920, more Americans lived in cities than on farms for the first time. Cities grew rapidly, often leading to overcrowding, pollution, and the need for new infrastructure like subways and skyscrapers.
*   **Societal Impact:** A new class of wealthy industrialists emerged, alongside a growing, prosperous middle class of managers and professionals. However, it also created a large industrial working class facing often difficult and dangerous conditions, low wages, and economic insecurity, leading to the rise of labor unions. Everyday life changed dramatically with new consumer goods (factory-made clothing, canned food, household appliances), new forms of communication and transportation, and lives increasingly regulated by the clock rather than the sun. Living standards generally rose, but wealth inequality became stark (leading to the term ""Gilded Age"").
*   **National Integration:** Previously isolated communities were linked into a national, and increasingly global, market and culture through transportation and communication networks. Local economies gave way to a national industrial economy.

In summary, the Second Industrial Revolution fundamentally reshaped the United States through technological breakthroughs, the rise of massive corporations employing new production and management techniques, and the creation of a national, urbanized, industrial economy. These changes were widespread, impacting nearly every aspect of American life, from work and business to communication, transportation, and social structure.",search
15,"“Describe the
characteristics of the Second Industrial Revolution in the US, providing specific
examples. Be sure to discuss changes in the structure of firms, how the transformation
occurred, and how widespread these changes were.” ","Okay, let's break down the characteristics of the Second Industrial Revolution in the United States (roughly 1870-1914).

**Core Characteristics:**

The Second Industrial Revolution was fundamentally characterized by:

1.  **New Technologies and Industries:** Unlike the First Industrial Revolution (focused on textiles, steam, iron), the Second was driven by advancements in **steel, chemicals, petroleum (oil), and electricity**.
    *   **Example:** The development of the **Bessemer Process** (and later the open-hearth process) made the mass production of high-quality, low-cost **steel** possible. Steel rapidly replaced iron in railroads (stronger rails supporting heavier loads), construction (allowing for skyscrapers and larger bridges), and machinery.
    *   **Example:** The **refining of petroleum** initially yielded kerosene for lighting (replacing whale oil), but later provided gasoline, fueling the internal combustion engine and the nascent automobile industry. **John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil** dominated this sector.
    *   **Example:** The harnessing of **electricity** by innovators like **Thomas Edison** (direct current, light bulb, phonograph) and **Nikola Tesla/George Westinghouse** (alternating current) revolutionized lighting (allowing factories to operate 24/7) and provided a new power source for factories, leading to more flexible factory layouts not tied to water or steam power sources.
    *   **Example:** Advancements in industrial **chemistry** led to new dyes, fertilizers, explosives, and early plastics.

2.  **Mass Production and Economies of Scale:** The new technologies enabled production on an unprecedented scale. Factories became larger, more mechanized, and focused on producing standardized goods for a national market.
    *   **Example:** **Andrew Carnegie's steel mills**, like the Edgar Thomson Works near Pittsburgh, utilized the Bessemer process and integrated processes to produce vast quantities of steel rails efficiently.
    *   **Example:** Later in the period, **Henry Ford's** development of the **moving assembly line** for the Model T automobile epitomized mass production, drastically reducing costs and making cars accessible to a wider market.

3.  **Improved Transportation and Communication:** Existing technologies were refined and expanded, knitting the country together.
    *   **Example:** The **transcontinental railroad** network was completed and vastly expanded, using the new steel rails. This created a truly national market, allowing manufacturers to distribute goods widely and access raw materials from distant regions. Refrigerated rail cars enabled the growth of the meatpacking industry in cities like Chicago.
    *   **Example:** The **telegraph** network expanded, and the invention of the **telephone** by **Alexander Graham Bell** (1876) further accelerated business communication.

**Changes in the Structure of Firms:**

This era witnessed a dramatic shift away from small, localized, often family-owned businesses towards large, complex corporate structures:

1.  **Rise of the Corporation:** The modern corporation, with limited liability for shareholders and the ability to raise vast amounts of capital through stock sales, became the dominant form of business organization for large enterprises.
2.  **Vertical Integration:** Firms sought to control all aspects of production, from raw materials to distribution.
    *   **Example:** **Carnegie Steel** owned iron ore mines, coal fields, ships and railroads to transport materials, and the steel mills themselves. This reduced reliance on external suppliers and captured profits at every stage.
    *   **Example:** **Gustavus Swift** in meatpacking controlled cattle ranching, refrigerated rail cars, slaughterhouses, and distribution networks.
3.  **Horizontal Integration:** Firms sought to dominate a single stage of production or distribution by buying out or merging with competitors, often leading to monopolies or near-monopolies (trusts).
    *   **Example:** **John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil** systematically acquired or eliminated competing oil refineries, eventually controlling about 90% of the US refining capacity through the **Standard Oil Trust**.
4.  **Emergence of Professional Management:** Running these large, complex organizations required specialized skills. A new class of salaried, professional managers emerged, distinct from the owners, creating bureaucratic structures with clear hierarchies and divisions of labor (e.g., departments for purchasing, production, sales, accounting).
5.  **Role of Finance Capitalism:** Large investment banks, like J.P. Morgan & Co., played a crucial role in financing these massive industrial consolidations, often orchestrating mergers and reorganizations (e.g., Morgan's creation of U.S. Steel in 1901 by merging Carnegie Steel and other firms).

**How the Transformation Occurred:**

Several factors converged to drive this transformation:

1.  **Technological Innovation:** As discussed, breakthroughs in steel, electricity, chemicals, and oil processing were fundamental enablers.
2.  **Abundant Natural Resources:** The US possessed vast reserves of coal, iron ore, oil, timber, and other raw materials necessary for industrial production.
3.  **Large and Growing Labor Supply:** Mass immigration (primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe during this period) and migration from rural areas provided the workforce for factories.
4.  **Expanding Domestic Market:** Population growth and the railroad network created a large, unified market hungry for manufactured goods.
5.  **Available Capital:** Profits from earlier industries, foreign investment, and the development of sophisticated capital markets (stock and bond markets, investment banks) provided the necessary funding.
6.  **Supportive Government Policies:** While sometimes described as ""laissez-faire,"" government actively supported industrial growth through high protective tariffs (shielding US industries from foreign competition), land grants for railroads, and generally limited regulation of business practices (until the Progressive Era).
7.  **Entrepreneurial Spirit:** Figures like Carnegie, Rockefeller, Edison, and Ford possessed the vision, ambition, and ruthlessness to build vast industrial empires.

**How Widespread Were These Changes?**

The impact of the Second Industrial Revolution was profound but **uneven**:

1.  **Geographic Concentration:** Industrialization was heavily concentrated in the **Northeast and Midwest** (the ""Manufacturing Belt"" or ""Rust Belt""). Cities like Pittsburgh (steel), Chicago (meatpacking, rail hub), Detroit (automobiles), and Cleveland (oil refining, manufacturing) became industrial powerhouses.
2.  **The South:** Lagged significantly behind. Still largely agrarian and recovering from the Civil War and Reconstruction, the South lacked capital, had a less developed transportation network (though improving), and its labor system was based on sharecropping and low-wage, often racially segregated, industries like textiles.
3.  **The West:** Primarily remained a supplier of raw materials (mining, timber, agriculture) to the industrial East, heavily reliant on railroads controlled by Eastern interests. While cities grew, large-scale manufacturing was less prevalent than resource extraction.
4.  **Social Impact:** The changes created immense wealth for industrialists (""Robber Barons"" or ""Captains of Industry,"" depending on perspective) and fostered the growth of a white-collar middle class (managers, clerks, professionals). However, it also created a large industrial working class facing difficult conditions: long hours, low wages, dangerous workplaces, and periodic unemployment. This led to labor unrest and the rise of unions.
5.  **Economic Dominance:** By the end of this period (WWI), the US had surpassed Britain and Germany to become the world's leading industrial power. The large corporation became the defining feature of the American economy.

In conclusion, the Second Industrial Revolution fundamentally reshaped the American economy and society. Driven by new technologies and fueled by various supporting factors, it led to mass production, the rise of large corporations with new organizational structures, and the creation of a national market. While these changes established the foundation for modern America, their impact was geographically concentrated and created significant social stratification and regional disparities.",non-search

        *   [https://discuss.px4.io/](https://discuss.px4.io/)

3.  **Component Selection & Suppliers:** Building a heavy-lift drone requires high-power components. You'll need to research and select appropriate:
    *   **Frames:** Often custom-built or using large pre-made carbon fiber frames (Hexacopter/Octocopter configurations are common for redundancy and lift). Look at suppliers like Tarot, T-Motor, or specialized heavy-lift frame manufacturers.
    *   **Motors & ESCs:** High-thrust, low-KV motors paired with high-amperage ESCs are necessary. Brands like T-Motor, KDE Direct, or Hobbywing produce components suitable for heavy lift. You'll need to use motor calculators (like eCalc) to estimate performance.
    *   **Propellers:** Large diameter propellers (e.g., 28 inches and up) made of carbon fiber are typical.
    *   **Flight Controllers:** Robust Pixhawk/Cube variants (e.g., Cube Orange, Pixhawk 6X) are commonly used.
    *   **Batteries:** High-capacity, high-discharge LiPo or Li-Ion battery packs (often multiple packs run in parallel/series).
    *   **Power Distribution:** Heavy-duty power distribution boards (PDBs) or harnesses capable of handling high currents.
    *   **GPS & Sensors:** Reliable RTK GPS for precision agriculture is often desired, plus standard sensors (IMU, barometer, magnetometer).

4.  **Example Builds/Inspiration (Conceptual):** While not full plans, searching for university projects, research papers, or blog posts about building large drones can provide insights. Search terms like ""DIY heavy lift drone build,"" ""custom octocopter build log,"" ""ArduPilot large drone project.""

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Complexity:** Building a drone equivalent to a P100 or T40 is an advanced engineering project. It's not a beginner or intermediate-level build.
*   **Cost:** High-power components are expensive. A DIY heavy-lift drone can easily cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.
*   **Safety:** Large drones with significant payload capacity pose serious safety risks if they fail. Redundancy, careful construction, and thorough testing are critical.
*   **Regulations:** Operating drones of this size and weight (especially for commercial purposes like agriculture) is heavily regulated in most countries. You will need to research and comply with all local laws, which may include pilot certification, drone registration, operational permits, and restricted flight zones.
*   **Payload Integration:** Integrating and controlling specialized payloads like sprayers or spreaders adds another layer of complexity to both the hardware setup and software configuration.

In summary, while exact plans for replicas aren't available openly, the resources above, particularly within the ArduPilot and PX4 communities, provide the foundation and information needed to *design and build* a custom heavy-lift drone. Be prepared for a complex, expensive, and regulation-bound project.",search
21,"Provide links to bill of materials, plans or open instructions that would allow someone to build a heavy lift drone  equivalent of a  XAG P100 , DJI T40 or similar.","Okay, let's address the request to build a heavy-lift drone equivalent to an XAG P100 or DJI Agras T40.

First, it's crucial to understand a few key points:

1.  **Complexity & Integration:** The XAG P100 and DJI T40 are highly integrated, commercial systems developed with significant R&D investment. They use proprietary flight controllers, software, sensor suites (like radar for terrain following and obstacle avoidance), and specialized spraying/spreading systems. Replicating their exact performance and features using off-the-shelf or open-source components is extremely challenging, if not impossible.
2.  **Safety:** Drones capable of lifting 40kg+ payloads are inherently dangerous if they fail. Commercial manufacturers invest heavily in safety features, redundancy, and rigorous testing. A DIY build of this scale requires exceptional care, high-quality components, and thorough testing.
3.  **Cost:** While potentially cheaper than buying a commercial unit (which can cost $20,000-$30,000+), building a reliable drone of this scale is still very expensive. High-power motors, large ESCs, high-capacity batteries, a robust frame, and advanced flight controllers/sensors will likely cost many thousands of dollars ($5,000 - $15,000+ is realistic, depending on component choices and required features).
4.  **Proprietary Information:** Companies like DJI and XAG do *not* release their detailed plans, schematics, or full bill of materials. You won't find official open instructions to replicate their specific models.
5.  **Regulation:** Drones of this size and weight are subject to strict aviation regulations in most countries, often requiring special certifications, permits, and pilot licenses.

**Building a Generic Heavy-Lift Drone (Open Source Approach):**

Instead of an exact replica, you can aim to build a *custom* heavy-lift multirotor using open-source principles and components. This is still an advanced project. Here are the types of resources and components you would need to research and source:

**1. Flight Controller Platform (The Brain):**
*   **ArduPilot (Based on Pixhawk hardware):** This is the most common open-source platform for larger, custom drone builds. It's highly capable and configurable. You'll need compatible hardware (like a Cube Orange, Pixhawk 4/5/6, etc.).
    *   **Website:** [https://ardupilot.org/](https://ardupilot.org/)
    *   **Documentation (Copter):** [https://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html](https://ardupilot.org/copter/index.html) (Essential reading!)
    *   **Hardware Overview:** [https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-autopilots.html](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-autopilots.html)
*   **PX4 (Also uses Pixhawk hardware):** Another powerful open-source flight stack.
    *   **Website:** [https://px4.io/](https://px4.io/)
    *   **User Guide:** [https://docs.px4.io/main/en/](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/)

**2. Frame:**
*   There are no standard open-source plans for frames specifically matching the T40/P100 payload class.
*   You will likely need to:
    *   **Design your own:** Using CAD software, considering materials like large-diameter carbon fiber tubes, T-joints, and custom CNC-machined motor mounts and landing gear.
    *   **Purchase a generic heavy-lift frame:** Companies like Tarot, FoxtechFPV, KDE Direct, or custom frame builders sometimes offer large frames (e.g., X8, Hexa configurations) designed for heavy payloads, but perhaps not quite 40kg+. You'd need to verify payload capacity. *Finding off-the-shelf frames for 40kg+ liquid payloads is difficult.*

**3. Propulsion System (Motors, ESCs, Propellers):**
*   **This is critical and requires careful calculation.** You need components rated for the massive thrust required.
*   **Motors:** Look at large, low-KV motors from brands like T-Motor (e.g., U-series like U15, U13, U11), KDE Direct, or similar industrial drone motor suppliers.
*   **ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers):** High-amperage ESCs (100A+), often with CAN bus communication for better reliability and telemetry. Brands matching the motors are common (T-Motor Flame/Alpha, KDE).
*   **Propellers:** Large diameter (30+ inches), potentially foldable carbon fiber propellers.
*   **Calculation Tool:** Use a tool like eCalc ([https://www.ecalc.ch/xcoptercalc.php](https://www.ecalc.ch/xcoptercalc.php)) to estimate thrust, flight time, and component suitability. *You'll need the paid version for larger models.* Input your estimated total weight (frame, components, batteries, payload) and experiment with motor/prop/battery combinations.

**4. Power System (Batteries & Power Distribution):**
*   **Batteries:** High-capacity, high-discharge LiPo or LiHV batteries (e.g., multiple 12S or 14S packs, 22000mAh+ each, run in parallel). Consider brands specializing in large drone batteries (e.g., Tattu Gens Ace).
*   **Power Distribution:** A heavy-duty Power Distribution Board (PDB) or a custom wiring harness using thick gauge wire (e.g., 8 AWG, 6 AWG) and high-quality connectors (AS150, XT90 are often too small; QS8, QS10 might be needed). A Power Module compatible with the flight controller (e.g., Mauch) is essential for voltage/current monitoring.

**5. GPS & Sensors:**
*   **GPS:** High-quality GPS module, preferably RTK capable (e.g., u-blox ZED-F9P based) for precision agriculture tasks. Requires a ground base station for RTK.
*   **Other Sensors:** Barometer (usually built into FC), IMU (built into FC), optional LIDAR for altitude hold, optional Radar/LIDAR for obstacle avoidance (integrating these reliably with ArduPilot/PX4 for avoidance is complex).

**6. Radio Control & Telemetry:**
*   Standard RC system (e.g., FrSky, TBS Crossfire, ELRS) for manual control/backup.
*   Telemetry radio (e.g., SiK radios, RFD900x) for communication with a Ground Control Station (GCS).

**7. Ground Control Station (GCS):**
*   Software like Mission Planner or QGroundControl running on a laptop/tablet.

**8. Payload System (Sprayer/Spreader):**
*   This is highly custom. You would need to source/build:
    *   Tank
    *   Pump (e.g., 12V diaphragm pump)
    *   Nozzles & plumbing
    *   Control mechanism (e.g., using a servo or relay controlled by the flight controller's auxiliary outputs).
    *   Integrating flow control and variable rate application requires significant custom configuration in ArduPilot/PX4.

**Where to Find Community/Build Logs (Likely smaller scale, but principles apply):**
*   **ArduPilot Discussion Forums:** [https://discuss.ardupilot.org/](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/) - Search for ""heavy lift,"" specific motor types, or frame configurations. You might find build logs or discussions.
*   **PX4 Discussion Forums:** [https://discuss.px4.io/](https://discuss.px4.io/)
*   **DIYDrones (Older but still has archives):** [https://diydrones.com/](https://diydrones.com/)
*   **RCGroups Forums:** [https://www.rcgroups.com/multirotor-drones-659/](https://www.rcgroups.com/multirotor-drones-659/) - Look in the larger multirotor sections.

**Conclusion:**

There are no readily available, open-source ""plans"" or ""BOMs"" to build an exact equivalent of a DJI T40 or XAG P100. Building a drone of this scale requires significant engineering knowledge (mechanical, electrical, software), a substantial budget, rigorous testing, and a deep understanding of safety and regulatory requirements.

Your best bet is to leverage the ArduPilot/PX4 ecosystems, use calculation tools like eCalc extensively, research high-power components from specialized vendors, and potentially design and fabricate many parts yourself, especially the frame and payload system. Start by thoroughly reading the ArduPilot/PX4 documentation and exploring their forums.",non-search
22,как регулировать напряжение в сети? какие устройства разработаны? назови их авторов.,"Хорошо, давайте разберемся с регулированием напряжения в электрических сетях.

**Зачем нужно регулировать напряжение?**

Напряжение в электрической сети должно поддерживаться в определенных пределах (обычно ±5% или ±10% от номинального значения). Отклонения от нормы могут привести к:

*   **Пониженное напряжение (просадка):** Неправильная работа оборудования, снижение яркости ламп, перегрев двигателей, сбои электроники.
*   **Повышенное напряжение (перенапряжение):** Выход оборудования из строя, сокращение срока службы ламп и приборов, опасность для изоляции.

Регулирование необходимо, так как напряжение в сети постоянно меняется из-за изменений нагрузки (подключение/отключение потребителей) и режимов работы генераторов.

**Как регулируют напряжение?**

Регулирование напряжения — это комплексный процесс, происходящий на разных уровнях энергосистемы:

1.  **На уровне генерации:**
    *   **Системы возбуждения генераторов:** Основной способ регулирования на электростанциях. Изменяя ток в обмотке возбуждения ротора синхронного генератора, можно изменять его выходное напряжение и количество вырабатываемой реактивной мощности. Этим процессом управляют **Автоматические Регуляторы Возбуждения (АРВ)**.

2.  **На уровне передачи и распределения (в сетях и на подстанциях):**
    *   **Трансформаторы с Регулированием Под Нагрузкой (РПН):** Это силовые трансформаторы (чаще всего на подстанциях), у которых можно изменять коэффициент трансформации без отключения от сети. Специальный переключатель (устройство РПН) изменяет количество витков в обмотке, тем самым регулируя напряжение на выходе трансформатора. Это основной способ регулирования напряжения в распределительных сетях.

23,как регулировать напряжение в сети? какие устройства разработаны? назови их авторов.,"Регулирование напряжения в электрической сети – это комплекс мер, направленных на поддержание напряжения в заданных пределах для обеспечения надежной и экономичной работы электрооборудования и потребителей. Уровень напряжения в сети тесно связан с балансом реактивной мощности: избыток реактивной мощности приводит к повышению напряжения, а недостаток – к его снижению.

**Способы регулирования напряжения:**

Существует несколько основных методов регулирования напряжения в электрических сетях:
1.  **Регулирование напряжения генераторами на электростанциях:** Изменение тока возбуждения генераторов позволяет менять их выходное напряжение и генерируемую реактивную мощность. Обычно напряжение на выходе генератора регулируется в пределах ±5% от номинального.
2.  **Изменение коэффициента трансформации трансформаторов:** Силовые трансформаторы оснащаются устройствами для изменения числа витков обмоток, что позволяет корректировать напряжение. Это может осуществляться:
    *   **Переключением без возбуждения (ПБВ):** Требует отключения трансформатора от сети, применяется для сезонной коррекции напряжения.
    *   **Регулированием под нагрузкой (РПН):** Позволяет изменять коэффициент трансформации без отключения трансформатора, используя специальные переключающие устройства.
3.  **Изменение параметров сети:** Влияние на напряжение через изменение сопротивления сети.
4.  **Регулирование потока реактивной мощности:** Использование компенсирующих устройств для генерации или потребления реактивной мощности в сети.
5.  **Встречное регулирование:** Метод, при котором напряжение в центре питания (например, на шинах подстанции) поддерживается тем выше, чем больше нагрузка, чтобы компенсировать падение напряжения в сети.

**Устройства для регулирования напряжения:**

Для реализации этих методов используются различные устройства:

24,cognitive load,"Okay, let's break down **Cognitive Load**.

In simple terms, **cognitive load** refers to the **total amount of mental effort being used in your working memory** at any given time.

Think of your working memory like the RAM (Random Access Memory) on a computer:

*   It has a **limited capacity**.
*   It's where you actively process information, solve problems, and learn new things.
*   If you try to run too many demanding programs at once, the computer slows down or crashes. Similarly, if your working memory is overloaded, your ability to think clearly, learn effectively, and make decisions suffers.

**Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)**, primarily developed by John Sweller, categorizes cognitive load into three types:

1.  **Intrinsic Cognitive Load:**
    *   This is the inherent difficulty of the topic or task itself.
    *   It depends on the complexity of the information (how many elements need to be processed simultaneously) and the learner's prior knowledge.
    *   *Example:* Learning basic addition has low intrinsic load for an adult, while understanding quantum physics has very high intrinsic load for almost everyone.
    *   This type is hard to change directly, although breaking complex topics into smaller parts can help manage it.

2.  **Extraneous Cognitive Load:**
    *   This is the ""bad"" kind of load. It's unnecessary mental effort caused by the *way* information is presented or the learning environment.
    *   It doesn't contribute to learning or understanding; it just consumes precious working memory resources.
    *   *Examples:* Poorly designed instructions, cluttered visuals, distracting sounds, unnecessary jargon, having to search for related information in different places.
    *   This is the type that instructional designers, UX designers, and educators aim to **minimize**.

3.  **Germane Cognitive Load:**
    *   This is the ""good"" kind of load. It's the mental effort directly involved in deep processing, understanding, constructing mental models (schemas), and connecting new information to existing knowledge.
    *   It's the effort that leads to actual learning and long-term retention.
    *   *Examples:* Thinking about how different concepts relate, applying a new formula to solve a problem, reflecting on how a historical event impacts the present.
    *   The goal is to **optimize** or **promote** this type of load, but only once extraneous load is minimized and intrinsic load is manageable.

**Why Does Cognitive Load Matter?**

Understanding cognitive load is crucial in many fields:

*   **Education & Training:** Designing materials and teaching methods that minimize extraneous load allows learners to dedicate more mental resources to understanding the core concepts (intrinsic) and processing them deeply (germane).
*   **User Experience (UX) & Interface Design:** Creating websites, apps, and software that are intuitive and easy to use reduces extraneous load, leading to less frustration and higher task completion rates.
*   **Workplace Productivity:** Overly complex procedures, constant interruptions, or poorly communicated information can overload employees, leading to errors, stress, and reduced efficiency.
*   **Everyday Life:** Trying to follow complex GPS directions while navigating heavy traffic imposes a high cognitive load, making driving more difficult and potentially dangerous.

**In summary:**

Cognitive load is about the limits of our working memory. By understanding its different types, we can design information, tasks, and environments more effectively – reducing unnecessary mental strain (extraneous load) and freeing up capacity for the effortful processing required for genuine learning and effective performance (managing intrinsic load and promoting germane load).",non-search
25,cognitive load,"Cognitive load refers to the mental effort used in the working memory. Developed by John Sweller in the late 1980s, Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) is based on the understanding that working memory has limited capacity and duration. This theory aims to provide guidelines for presenting information in a way that optimizes learning and intellectual performance by considering these limitations.

**Cognitive Load Theory and Memory:**
CLT explains how we learn by focusing on the interaction between working memory and long-term memory.
*   **Working Memory:** This is where new information is actively processed. It is limited in capacity, typically handling only a small amount of information (around 5-9 chunks) at once. Information must be processed here before it can potentially be stored long-term.
*   **Long-term Memory:** This is where knowledge is stored permanently in structures called ""schemas."" Schemas organize information, and the more developed they are, the easier it is to recall and use the information. Well-developed schemas count as single chunks in working memory, reducing the load.

**Types of Cognitive Load:**
Cognitive Load Theory typically identifies three types of cognitive load:
1.  **Intrinsic Cognitive Load:** This is the inherent difficulty associated with the specific topic or material being learned. It depends on the complexity of the material (number of interacting elements) and the learner's prior knowledge or expertise. This load cannot be altered by instructional design, but complex topics can often be broken down into smaller parts.
2.  **Extraneous Cognitive Load:** This load is generated by the way information is presented to the learner and is not directly related to the learning task itself. It's considered the ""bad"" type of load because it consumes working memory resources without contributing to schema construction. Poor instructional design, distractions, unnecessary information (like decorative graphics or background music), or confusing layouts can increase extraneous load.
3.  **Germane Cognitive Load:** This refers to the productive mental effort dedicated to processing information, constructing schemas, and integrating new knowledge with existing knowledge in long-term memory. It's the work put into deep processing and learning.

Some researchers debate the necessity of distinguishing Germane Load, suggesting it might be encompassed within managing intrinsic and extraneous load. However, many find the concept useful for focusing instructional design on promoting deep processing. The goal of effective instruction is often described as minimizing extraneous load and optimizing intrinsic load to free up working memory capacity for germane load.

**Effects of High Cognitive Load (Cognitive Overload):**
When the total cognitive load (intrinsic + extraneous + germane) exceeds the working memory's capacity, cognitive overload occurs. This can lead to:
*   Difficulty understanding content and processing new information.
*   Slower or ineffective learning.
*   Impaired transfer of information to long-term memory.
*   Increased errors and reduced task performance.
*   Difficulty concentrating and forgetfulness.
*   Feelings of being overwhelmed, stressed, or anxious.
*   Poor decision-making.
*   Increased reliance on stereotypes and subconscious processing.
*   Decreased productivity and motivation.
*   Potential burnout in work environments.

Certain groups, like the elderly, students, and children, may experience higher cognitive load more frequently.

**Managing Cognitive Load (Especially in Learning):**
Instructional design based on CLT aims to manage cognitive load to optimize learning. Strategies include:
*   **Reducing Extraneous Load:**
    *   Present information clearly and concisely.
    *   Remove non-essential information, distractions, or decorative elements.
    *   Present related information together (e.g., labels integrated into diagrams) to avoid splitting attention.
    *   Use both visual and auditory channels to present information, but avoid redundancy (like narrating on-screen text word-for-word).
*   **Managing Intrinsic Load:**
    *   Break down complex information into smaller, manageable chunks.
    *   Sequence content logically, often from simple to complex.
    *   Activate prior knowledge to connect new information to existing schemas.
*   **Promoting Germane Load:**
    *   Use worked examples, especially for novices, to demonstrate processes.
    *   Provide scaffolding (like models, prompts, checklists) and gradually remove it as learners gain proficiency.
    *   Encourage active processing and reflection, like asking students to explain concepts in their own words.
    *   Ensure a learning-focused environment free from distractions.

By managing cognitive load, educators and designers can help learners focus their limited working memory resources on understanding material and building lasting knowledge. Cognitive load is also a consideration in user experience (UX) design, aiming to make interfaces easy to understand and interact with.",search

Try placing a hand over your heart and saying something gentle like, ""This is really hard right now. May I be kind to myself.""
2.  **Mindful Breathing (5-Minute Reset):** Focus solely on your breath for a few minutes. Notice the sensation of air entering and leaving your body. When your mind wanders (which it will), gently guide it back to the breath. This grounds you in the present moment.
3.  **Identify One ""Tiny Victory"":** Acknowledge one small thing you managed to do, no matter how insignificant it seems (e.g., got out of bed, drank a glass of water, replied to a text). This combats feelings of helplessness.
4.  **Gentle Cognitive Reframe:** Notice a negative thought (e.g., ""This will never get better""). Don't try to force positivity, but gently question its absoluteness. Ask: ""Is it *possible* things might feel slightly different tomorrow? Have I felt this way before and seen it shift, even a little?""
5.  **Sensory Grounding (5-4-3-2-1):** Engage your senses to pull yourself out of overwhelming thoughts. Name: 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel (touch), 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste (or just focus on the sensation in your mouth).
6.  **Schedule One Small Pleasure:** Intentionally plan one small, achievable thing you find pleasant or soothing, even if it's just for 10 minutes (e.g., listening to a favorite song, sipping warm tea, looking at nature photos, reading a chapter of a book).
7.  **Gratitude Moment (Internal or Written):** Think of one specific thing you feel even mildly grateful for *right now*. It could be the warmth of a blanket, a pet nearby, or even just the fact that you're breathing. Focusing on gratitude, even when small, shifts perspective.
8.  **Acknowledge & Validate Feelings (Instead of Fighting Them):** Simply name the emotion you're feeling (""I feel discouraged,"" ""I feel lonely,"" ""I feel frustrated"") without judging it or needing to fix it immediately. Allowing the feeling can sometimes lessen its intensity.
9.  **Connect with Nature (Accessible):** If possible, sit near a window and watch the clouds, trees, or birds. If mobility allows, spend a few minutes outside. If not, look at nature documentaries or pictures online. Nature has restorative qualities.
10. **Low-Stakes Social Reach-Out:** Send a simple text, email, or social media message to someone – maybe just sharing an interesting article, a photo, or a simple ""Thinking of you."" It doesn't require a long conversation but maintains a thread of connection.
11. **Engage in a Passive Hobby:** Sometimes active engagement is too much. Allow yourself to passively enjoy something like listening to an audiobook or podcast, watching a comforting movie or show, or listening to music.
12. **Recall Past Resilience:** Think of a previous time you faced a challenge (related to illness or not) and got through it. Remind yourself of the coping skills you used then. You have inner resources.
13. **Break Down One Overwhelming Task:** If something feels too big (e.g., tidying a room), break it down into the absolute smallest first step (e.g., put one thing away). Doing just that tiny step can create momentum.
14. **Mindful Observation:** Choose an everyday object (a cup, a plant, your hand) and observe it intently for a minute, noticing details you usually overlook (texture, color variations, shape). This anchors you in the present.
15. **Gentle Movement (Adapted):** If possible and approved by your doctor, do some very gentle stretches or movements *within your limits*. Even small movements like wrist circles or neck rolls can help release tension and shift mood slightly.
16. **Creative Outlet (Low Energy):** Engage in a simple creative act. This could be doodling, coloring in an adult coloring book, writing a few sentences in a journal, or arranging objects nicely on a bedside table.
17. **Listen to Uplifting or Calming Music:** Create a playlist specifically for discouraging moments. Music directly impacts mood centers in the brain.
18. **Visit an Online Support Group or Forum:** Connecting with others who share similar experiences (chronic illness, loneliness) can reduce isolation and provide validation and practical tips. Reading or lurking is okay if active participation feels like too much.
19. **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** When feeling overwhelmed by limitations, shift focus to small things within your control – choosing what to watch, deciding when to rest, picking out a comfortable outfit.
20. **Write Down Worries (Worry Dump):** Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and write down everything that's worrying you. Getting it out of your head and onto paper can sometimes make it feel more manageable and less consuming. You don't need to solve them, just externalize them.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Be Gentle:** Don't expect huge shifts immediately. The goal is small, incremental improvements in coping.
*   **Adaptability:** Modify these techniques to fit your energy levels and physical abilities on any given day.
*   **Not a Replacement for Professional Help:** If discouragement is persistent, severe, or accompanied by thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to a mental health professional or a crisis hotline. These techniques are supportive tools, not substitutes for therapy or medical advice.
*   **Experiment:** Not every technique will resonate. Try different ones to see what works best for you in different moments.",non-search

","Okay, let's review and refine this GraphQL schema for a poker game. It's a solid start, covering many essential concepts. Here are some observations, suggestions, and potential refinements:

**Strengths:**

1.  **Clear Core Entities:** `Game`, `Hand`, `Player`, `Card` are well-defined.
2.  **Enums for Structure:** Using enums (`Suit`, `Rank`, `ActionName`, `HandStatus`, etc.) is excellent practice for defining fixed sets of values.
3.  **Event-Driven Approach:** The `HandEvent` union and subscriptions (`handEvents`, `gameEvents`) are crucial for real-time updates, which is essential for a game.
4.  **State Tracking:** `HandStatus` and `GameStatus` track the progression effectively.
5.  **Hand Results:** `HandResult` captures the necessary information about a hand's conclusion.
6.  **Hole Card Privacy:** `PlayerHoleCards` includes `isRevealed`, which is vital.

**Areas for Potential Refinement:**

1.  **Player State within a Hand:**
    *   `Player.isFolded` and `Player.isAllIn` represent a player's state *within a specific hand*, not necessarily their overall state in the game (especially in cash games where players can sit out).
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider creating a `HandPlayer` type or embedding hand-specific player state within the `Hand` type. This clarifies that `isFolded`/`isAllIn` pertain to the current or a specific hand. Let's adjust `Hand.players` to reflect this.

2.  **`Hand.players`:**
    *   Currently `[Player!]!`. Does this list change if players fold? Or does it represent all players dealt into the hand?
    *   **Suggestion:** Rename/refine this. Maybe `seatedPlayers` or `playersDealtIn`. It should probably link to a type that includes hand-specific status like `amountBetThisRound`, `isFolded`, `isAllIn`.

3.  **`HandResult.winner`:**
    *   It's an array `[Player!]!`, which is good for split pots.
    *   **Suggestion:** Often, you just need the `playerId`s of the winners in the result summary. Returning the full `Player` object might be unnecessary overhead or could imply returning the *current* state of the player, not their state at the time of winning. Consider changing to `winnerPlayerIds: [ID!]!`.

4.  **`HandResult` Redundancy:**
    *   You have `winningHand: HandType` and `winningHandType: HandType`. These seem identical.
    *   **Suggestion:** Remove `winningHand` and keep `winningHandType: HandType`. Ensure it's nullable (`HandType`) for cases where the hand ends before showdown.

5.  **`HandProgression.cards`:**
    *   This likely represents the *new* community cards dealt at that stage (Flop: 3, Turn: 1, River: 1).
    *   **Suggestion:** Rename for clarity, e.g., `revealedCommunityCards: [Card!]!`.

6.  **`Game.hands` Pagination:**
    *   You noted this yourself. Retrieving all hands for a long game is infeasible.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add pagination arguments (e.g., `first`, `after`, `last`, `before`) following Relay or basic cursor/offset patterns.

7.  **`GameEvent.descriptipn`:**
    *   Typo: Should be `description`.
    *   **Suggestion:** Instead of a generic `description`, consider making `GameEvent` an interface or union with specific event types (`PlayerJoinedEvent`, `PlayerLeftEvent`, `StatusChangedEvent`, etc.) for more structured data. A simpler alternative is adding an `eventType: GameEventType!` enum.

8.  **`Mutation.postBlind`:**
    *   Blinds are typically posted automatically at the start of a hand based on dealer position and game rules, not as a distinct player action *mutation*. This mutation might be for specific edge cases (like posting a missed blind upon returning), but seems potentially unnecessary for standard flow.
    *   **Suggestion:** Evaluate if this mutation is truly needed. The game engine should likely handle mandatory blind posting internally when a new hand starts. The `POST_BLIND` action within `PlayerAction` might be sufficient to *record* the event if needed.

9.  **`Mutation.playerAction` Return Type:**
    *   Returning `PlayerAction!` means the client only gets confirmation of the action itself. They likely need the updated state of the `Hand` (new `activePlayerIndex`, `pot`, `currentBet`, `handStatus`, etc.).
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider returning the updated `Hand!` object from the `playerAction` mutation.

10. **`Mutation.joinGame` Initial Stack:**
    *   For `CASH` games, a player needs an initial stack.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add `initialStack: Int!` to the `joinGame` mutation, perhaps making it optional or required based on `GameType`.

11. **`Subscription.gameEvents` Return Type:**
    *   Returning the entire `Game!` object on every minor game event (like status change) might be excessive.
    *   **Suggestion:** Return the specific `GameEvent!` (or the refined structured event type/union) that occurred.

12. **`Time` Scalar:** Ensure you have a corresponding scalar implementation on the server (e.g., mapping to ISO 8601 string or Unix timestamp). `DateTime` is a more common name for this standard scalar.

13. **`PlayerAction.isAllIn`:** Is this boolean necessary? An action's `amount` matching the player's remaining stack implicitly means they are all-in. However, keeping it explicit can be helpful for the client. It's acceptable but slightly redundant.

14. **Clarity on Indices:** `currentDealerIndex` and `activePlayerIndex` refer to indices within which list? The `Game.players` list or the `Hand.players` list? Add comments to clarify. Assume `Game.currentDealerIndex` relates to `Game.players` and `Hand.activePlayerIndex` relates to the players involved in that specific hand.

**Key Changes Summary:**

1.  **`HandPlayer`:** Introduced to manage player state *within* a hand. `Hand.players` now uses this type.
2.  **Player Stack:** Clarified stack terminology (`stackAtHandStart`, `currentStack` in `HandPlayer`).
3.  **`HandResult`:** Simplified winner info to `winnerPlayerIds`, removed duplicate `winningHand` field.
4.  **Event Naming:** Renamed `HandProgression` to `HandRoundProgression` and `cards` to `revealedCommunityCards`.
5.  **Pagination:** Added `HandConnection`, `GameConnection`, `GameEventConnection`, and `PageInfo` for paginating `Game.hands`, `Query.games`, and `Game.gameEvents`.
6.  **`GameEvent`:** Made more structured with `GameEventType` enum and `message`. Renamed `descriptipn`.
7.  **Mutations:** Removed `postBlind`, changed `playerAction` to return `Hand!`, added `initialStack` to `joinGame`.
8.  **Subscriptions:** Changed `gameEvents` subscription to return `GameEvent!`.
9.  **Scalar:** Renamed `Time` to the more standard `DateTime`.
10. **Enums:** Refined `HandStatus`, removed `HEADSUP` from `GameType` (can be inferred by player count/limits), removed `NOACTION` from `ActionName`. Added `PAUSED` to `GameStatus`.
11. **Comments:** Added more documentation strings (`""""""Docstrings""""""`).
12. **Nullability/Clarity:** Adjusted nullability (e.g., `PlayerAction.isAllIn` made non-null) and clarified index meanings.

This revised schema provides a more robust and clearer structure for building a poker game application. Remember that the actual game logic (determining winners, valid moves, turn order, etc.) resides in your backend resolvers.",non-search

34,project orion is so powerful and enables humanity to have specific impulse of >100k seconds with current technology and current engineering.,"That's a fascinating and optimistic take on Project Orion! Let's break down the statement:

1.  **""Project Orion is so powerful...""**
    *   **True in concept.** Project Orion (nuclear pulse propulsion) is conceptually one of the most powerful propulsion systems ever devised. By detonating small nuclear devices behind a massive pusher plate, it could theoretically generate immense thrust and high specific impulse (Isp), far exceeding chemical rockets. This would enable missions with very large payloads and potentially much faster interplanetary or even interstellar travel.

2.  **""...enables humanity to have specific impulse of >100k seconds...""**
    *   **Theoretically possible, but extremely ambitious.** While theoretical designs, particularly those using advanced fusion devices (rather than the fission or fission-fusion devices focused on in the original project), could potentially reach Isp values in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of seconds range, the original Project Orion designs (1950s-60s) were typically targeting Isp in the range of roughly 2,000 to 10,000 seconds, perhaps up to 20,000 s for more advanced concepts considered then. Achieving >100,000 s would require highly efficient, likely pure fusion pulse units and very advanced engineering, pushing beyond the scope of the original project's goals and likely beyond what we can easily field today.

3.  **""...with current technology and current engineering.""**
    *   **This is the most debatable part.** While we certainly have a much deeper understanding of nuclear physics, materials science, and engineering than in the 1960s, stating we could readily build a >100k Isp Orion *today* is problematic:
        *   **Nuclear Pulse Units:** While we can build nuclear devices, designing and mass-producing small, highly reliable, efficient, and *specifically tailored* pulse units (especially fusion-based ones needed for very high Isp) is a significant challenge beyond just weaponizing fissile material. This technology isn't readily available off-the-shelf for propulsion.
        *   **Pusher Plate & Shock Absorbers:** The engineering challenges of creating a pusher plate and shock absorption system capable of withstanding thousands of nuclear detonations (intense heat, radiation, mechanical shock) are immense. While materials are better today, this remains a cutting-edge problem, especially for the performance required for >100k Isp.
        *   **Radiation Shielding:** Protecting the crew and sensitive equipment requires massive shielding, which is an understood engineering challenge but adds complexity and mass.
        *   **Testing & Treaties:** Ground testing is virtually impossible due to fallout. Space testing involves detonating nuclear devices, which is prohibited by international agreements like the Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963) and the Outer Space Treaty (1967). These legal and political hurdles are perhaps the biggest *current* barrier, regardless of the purely technical feasibility.
        *   **System Integration:** Building and operating such a complex system reliably is a monumental engineering task that hasn't been undertaken.

**In Summary:**

Project Orion remains a compelling concept with unparalleled *potential* performance. While technology has advanced significantly since the 1960s, building an Orion drive, especially one achieving the extremely high Isp of >100,000 s, is *not* something we can simply do with ""current technology and current engineering"" off the shelf. It would require a dedicated, massive R&D effort, likely involving breakthroughs in pulse unit design and materials science, significant engineering validation, and crucially, a fundamental shift in international policy regarding nuclear devices in space.

The original, more modest Isp Orion designs (~few thousand seconds) might be closer to current *technical* reach (though still incredibly challenging and politically barred), but the >100k s goal pushes well into advanced future concepts.",non-search
35,project orion is so powerful and enables humanity to have specific impulse of >100k seconds with current technology and current engineering.,"Project Orion was indeed a powerful concept for spacecraft propulsion, studied seriously in the US from 1958 to 1965. It proposed using a series of controlled nuclear explosions behind the spacecraft to generate thrust against a large pusher plate.

Here's a breakdown of the points you raised:

**Specific Impulse (Isp):**
*   Specific impulse (Isp) measures the efficiency of a rocket engine. Project Orion offered significantly higher Isp than chemical rockets (like the Saturn V with ~263s Isp).
*   Estimates for Orion's Isp vary:
    *   Conservative estimates place it around 2,000 seconds.
    *   Air Force plans projected 4,000 to 6,000 seconds.
    *   Some sources cite a range of 6,000 seconds up to potentially 10,000 or 12,000 seconds for fission-based designs.
    *   More advanced *fusion* bomb designs proposed later by Freeman Dyson theoretically could reach over 75,000 seconds Isp.
    *   Some sources mention a theoretical maximum specific impulse of 100,000 seconds (1 MN·s/kg) might be possible with refinements to the Orion concept, potentially using magnetic shielding. Other designs related to nuclear pulse, like Medusa, also target the 50,000-100,000s range. However, achieving this reliably with the original fission-based Orion concept is less certain than the lower figures.

**Current Technology and Engineering:**
*   The fundamental engineering principles behind Project Orion were considered feasible with the technology available *in the 1950s and 1960s*. Studies concluded it was possible to build massive spacecraft capable of rapid interplanetary travel (e.g., Mars round trip in weeks) using materials and knowledge from that era.
*   However, Project Orion is *not* feasible to build today due to significant non-technical obstacles:
    *   **Treaties:** The Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, and subsequent treaties, prohibit nuclear explosions in the atmosphere, underwater, and in outer space. This was a major reason for the project's cancellation in 1965.
    *   **Environmental Concerns:** Launching an Orion vehicle from Earth would create significant radioactive fallout, though later designs focused on space-only use or non-nuclear initial boost stages. Even in space, repeated nuclear detonations pose challenges.
    *   **Political Will and Cost:** The political climate is strongly against deploying nuclear weapons in space, and the cost would be immense.

**In summary:** Project Orion was a concept with enormous potential, offering high thrust and specific impulse far beyond chemical rockets, potentially reaching into the tens of thousands of seconds Isp, with theoretical maximums approaching 100,000s. While the basic technology was considered viable in the 1960s, it is not buildable with ""current technology and engineering"" in a practical sense due to international treaties, environmental issues, and political factors.",search
36,"What are the birth defects risk probabilities when a pregnancy  comes from an incestuous relationship in humans, depeding on the different possible blood relations between the parents","Incestuous relationships, meaning sexual relations between closely related individuals, significantly increase the probability of offspring inheriting two copies of the same deleterious recessive allele from a common ancestor. This leads to a markedly higher risk of various birth defects, genetic disorders, and mortality compared to offspring from unrelated parents.

The risk is directly related to the **coefficient of inbreeding (F)**, which measures the probability that an individual inherits two copies of an allele that are identical by descent (i.e., originated from the same ancestral source). The closer the biological relationship between the parents, the higher the coefficient of inbreeding for their offspring, and thus the higher the risk.

Here's a breakdown of the risks based on the degree of relatedness:

1.  **General Population (Unrelated Parents):**
    *   Baseline risk for major congenital anomalies (birth defects): Approximately **2-4%**.
    *   Risk for severe genetic disorders or intellectual disability is lower but present.
    *   Coefficient of Inbreeding (F): Effectively 0 (or very close to it, depending on background population relatedness).

2.  **First Cousins (Share grandparents):**
    *   Coefficient of Relationship (r): 1/8 (share approx. 12.5% of their genes)
    *   Coefficient of Inbreeding (F) for offspring: 1/16 (6.25%)
    *   Risk: Studies consistently show an increased risk compared to the general population. The absolute risk for major congenital anomalies is often estimated to be roughly **double the baseline risk**, leading to a range of about **4-7%**. There is also an increased risk of infant mortality and autosomal recessive disorders.

3.  **Half-Siblings (Share one parent) / Uncle-Niece / Aunt-Nephew / Double First Cousins:**
    *   Coefficient of Relationship (r): 1/4 (share approx. 25% of their genes)
    *   Coefficient of Inbreeding (F) for offspring: 1/8 (12.5%)
    *   Risk: The risk is significantly higher than for first cousins and the general population. F is double that of first-cousin offspring. While precise figures are harder to establish due to rarity and study difficulties, the risk for congenital anomalies, genetic disorders, and mortality is expected to be substantially elevated, likely intermediate between first cousins and full siblings/parent-child.

4.  **Full Siblings / Parent-Child:**
    *   Coefficient of Relationship (r): 1/2 (share approx. 50% of their genes)
    *   Coefficient of Inbreeding (F) for offspring: 1/4 (25%)
    *   Risk: This represents the highest level of inbreeding commonly discussed. The risk for severe negative outcomes is dramatically increased.
        *   **Mortality:** Studies indicate significantly higher rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death, and infant/childhood mortality. Some estimates suggest mortality rates could be 20-40% higher or more compared to the general population, though figures vary widely.
        *   **Congenital Anomalies (Birth Defects):** The risk is substantially elevated, potentially reaching **10-30% or higher** for major anomalies, depending on the study and the specific conditions included.
        *   **Autosomal Recessive Disorders:** The probability of expressing rare recessive disorders carried in the family lineage increases dramatically.
        *   **Intellectual Disability:** A significantly increased risk of severe intellectual disability is well-documented.

**Summary of Risk Increase:**

*   **Baseline (Unrelated):** ~2-4% risk of major birth defects.
*   **First Cousins (F=1/16):** Risk roughly doubles (~4-7%).
*   **Half-Siblings, Uncle/Niece, etc. (F=1/8):** Risk is significantly higher than first cousins, intermediate level.
*   **Full Siblings, Parent-Child (F=1/4):** Risk is dramatically higher, potentially involving a substantial chance (>10-20%) of major birth defects, severe genetic disorders, intellectual disability, or early mortality.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** These are general probabilities. The *actual* risk for any specific pregnancy depends on the particular harmful recessive alleles carried within that specific family.
*   **Data Limitations:** Obtaining precise, large-scale data on the outcomes of incestuous pregnancies is ethically and practically challenging. Figures are often based on smaller studies, case reports, or extrapolations from consanguinity studies (like first-cousin marriages, which are more common and studied in some cultures). Confounding factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, lack of prenatal care, maternal health) can also be present in situations involving incest.
*   **Broad Definition:** ""Birth defects"" can encompass a wide range of issues, from structural anomalies (like heart defects) to metabolic disorders and neurodevelopmental problems. The increased risk applies across many categories, particularly those linked to recessive gene action.

In conclusion, the risk of birth defects and other severe negative health outcomes increases dramatically with the closeness of the biological relationship between parents in an incestuous union, due to the significantly elevated probability of the offspring inheriting two copies of deleterious recessive alleles. The highest risks are associated with parent-child and full-sibling relationships.",non-search
37,"What are the birth defects risk probabilities when a pregnancy  comes from an incestuous relationship in humans, depeding on the different possible blood relations between the parents","Pregnancies resulting from incestuous relationships (consanguinity) carry a higher risk of birth defects and genetic disorders compared to pregnancies between unrelated individuals. This increased risk is primarily due to the higher probability that both parents share the same harmful recessive gene variants inherited from a common ancestor. If a child inherits two copies of such a recessive variant, one from each related parent, they may develop a genetic disorder.

The probability of these risks varies depending on the degree of genetic relatedness between the parents:

**Baseline Risk (General Population):**
For comparison, the baseline risk of major birth defects in children born to unrelated parents is generally estimated to be between 2% and 5%.

**Risk Levels by Degree of Consanguinity:**

1.  **First-Degree Relatives (Parent-Child, Full Siblings):**
    *   These relationships involve the highest degree of genetic relatedness among prohibited pairings, sharing approximately 50% of their genes.
    *   The coefficient of inbreeding (F), which measures the probability that an individual inherits two copies of an allele identical by descent from a common ancestor, is 25% (or 0.25) for offspring of such unions.
    *   The risk of passing on a recessive genetic disease is significantly higher for siblings having children together compared to first cousins. For a specific recessive disease like cystic fibrosis, if both siblings are carriers, the risk of having an affected child can be much higher (e.g., 1 in 16) compared to if one sibling had a child with an unrelated person.
    *   Offspring from parent-child or sibling-sibling unions face an increased risk of congenital disorders, physical and developmental disabilities, and mortality compared to offspring from less closely related unions.

2.  **Second-Degree Relatives (Uncle/Niece, Aunt/Nephew, Half-Siblings, Grandparent/Grandchild):**
    *   These individuals share approximately 25% of their genes.
    *   The coefficient of inbreeding (F) for offspring is 12.5% (or 0.125).
    *   The risk for birth defects and genetic disorders is intermediate, higher than for first cousins but lower than for first-degree relatives.

3.  **Third-Degree Relatives (First Cousins):**
    *   First cousins share about 12.5% of their genes.
    *   The coefficient of inbreeding (F) for their offspring is 6.25% (or 0.0625).
    *   Studies estimate that the risk of birth defects for children of first cousins is roughly double the baseline risk, placing it around 4% to 6% or 5% to 6%.
    *   Some sources quantify this as an *additional* risk of 1.1% to 3% above the baseline population risk. For example, if the baseline is 3%, the risk for first cousins is about 6%.
    *   While the relative risk is increased, the absolute risk is still considered relatively small.
    *   Studies have linked first-cousin marriage to increased rates of autosomal recessive disorders and congenital anomalies. The risk of recurrence for birth defects in subsequent siblings is also higher if the parents are first cousins compared to unrelated parents.

4.  **More Distant Relatives (Second Cousins, etc.):**
    *   Second cousins (sharing a great-grandparent) have a coefficient of inbreeding (F) of 1.56% (or 0.0156).
    *   The risk decreases as the genetic relationship becomes more distant, but it remains slightly higher than for the general population. Marriages between third or fourth cousins have been associated with increased fertility in some historical populations.

**Mechanism: Autosomal Recessive Disorders**
Most people carry several potentially harmful recessive gene variants, but typically have a second, working copy of the gene, preventing disease. These individuals are called ""carriers"". Since closely related individuals inherit genes from common ancestors, they have a higher chance of both being carriers for the *same* recessive disorder (e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, Tay-Sachs disease, certain types of hearing loss). If both parents pass on the same recessive variant, the child inherits two non-working copies of the gene and will likely be affected by the disorder. The closer the biological relationship, the higher the probability they share the same recessive variants.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Cumulative Risk:** In communities where consanguineous marriage is common over many generations, the cumulative risk of genetic disorders can be higher than indicated by a single-generation calculation.
*   **Genetic Counseling:** Couples who are blood relatives are often advised to seek genetic counseling before conception or early in pregnancy to understand their specific risks. Genetic carrier screening can identify shared recessive mutations.
*   **Healthy Offspring:** It is important to note that the majority of children born to related parents are healthy. Consanguinity increases the *risk*, but does not guarantee that offspring will have a birth defect.

For personalized risk assessment, it is crucial to consult with healthcare professionals or genetic counselors who can consider the specific family history and degree of relatedness.",search
38,Tell me a fascinating thing about logic gates,"Okay, here's a fascinating thing about logic gates:

**You can build *any* digital circuit imaginable, including an entire complex computer processor, using *only one type* of logic gate: the NAND gate (or alternatively, the NOR gate).**

This property is called **functional completeness** or **universality**.

*   A **NAND** gate outputs `FALSE` (0) only if *all* its inputs are `TRUE` (1); otherwise, it outputs `TRUE` (1). (It's essentially Not-AND).
*   A **NOR** gate outputs `TRUE` (1) only if *all* its inputs are `FALSE` (0); otherwise, it outputs `FALSE` (0). (It's essentially Not-OR).

Think about it: the fundamental operations needed are AND, OR, and NOT.

*   You can make a NOT gate from a NAND gate by tying its inputs together.
*   You can make an AND gate by putting a NOT gate (made from a NAND) after a NAND gate.
*   You can make an OR gate using three NAND gates (leveraging De Morgan's theorem).

Since you can construct the basic AND, OR, and NOT functions purely from NAND gates (or purely from NOR gates), you can build *any* combinational or sequential logic circuit, no matter how complex, using only that single type of gate repeated over and over.

This is incredibly powerful from a design and manufacturing perspective. It means you only need to perfect the fabrication of one type of simple gate structure to build circuits of immense complexity. It's a beautiful example of how complex systems can emerge from very simple, repeating building blocks.",non-search
39,Tell me a fascinating thing about logic gates,"Okay, here's a fascinating aspect of logic gates:

**The concept of ""Universal Logic Gates""**.

While there are several fundamental types of logic gates (like AND, OR, NOT, XOR), it turns out you don't actually need all of them to build any possible digital logic circuit.

The **NAND** gate (Not-AND) and the **NOR** gate (Not-OR) are known as universal logic gates. This is fascinating because it means you can construct *any* other basic logic gate (AND, OR, NOT) and, by extension, any complex digital circuit, using *only* NAND gates or *only* NOR gates.

For example:
*   You can create a NOT gate by connecting both inputs of a single NAND gate together.
*   You can create an AND gate using two NAND gates.
*   You can create an OR gate using three NAND gates.
*   Similar constructions are possible using only NOR gates.

This property, sometimes called ""functional completeness,"" means that theoretically, you could build an entire computer, from the simplest function to the most complex microprocessor, using just one type of logic gate (either NAND or NOR) repeated many times. This universality simplifies the design and manufacturing of integrated circuits, and historically, some important computers, like the Apollo Guidance Computer, relied heavily on a single type of universal gate (NOR gates in that case).",search
