2,"The F-K grade level is a tool used to analyze the complexity of the user stories in terms of readability using different grade levels. The higher the grade level, the higher the complexity of the user stories therefore needing more expertise to understand the story. As seen above in \ref{tab:readability2}, the average words per story was extracted as it shows the correlation with the F-K grade computational logic. 

rewrite the text above to a more academic writing ","Here are a few options for rewriting the text with a more academic tone, depending on the specific emphasis you want:

**Option 1 (Focus on the Metric and its Interpretation):**

> The Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade level serves as a quantitative metric for evaluating the readability and complexity of user stories. According to this measure, higher F-K scores correspond to increased textual complexity. Consequently, user stories with elevated F-K grades necessitate a greater level of expertise for effective comprehension. Table \ref{tab:readability2} presents the average word count per story, a variable intrinsically linked to the F-K grade level calculation, thus providing empirical context for this relationship.

**Option 2 (More Concise):**

> The Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade level is utilized to assess the complexity of user stories based on readability metrics. Higher scores on this scale indicate greater complexity, implying that more specialized knowledge is required for comprehension. Data presented in Table \ref{tab:readability2}, specifically the average words per story, demonstrates a factor integral to the F-K computational logic and its correlation with perceived story complexity.

**Option 3 (Slightly more formal vocabulary):**

> Readability analysis of user stories was conducted using the Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade level metric. This instrument quantifies textual complexity, where ascending F-K scores denote progressively more intricate user stories. Such intricacy necessitates enhanced expertise for thorough understanding. As illustrated in Table \ref{tab:readability2}, the mean word count per story—a primary component of the F-K calculation—provides evidence supporting the link between story length and its assigned complexity grade.

Choose the option that best fits the overall tone and flow of your document. They all convey the same core information but use more formal sentence structures and vocabulary appropriate for academic writing.",search

rewrite the text above to a more academic writing ","Okay, here are a few options for rewriting that text with a more academic tone, ranging slightly in emphasis:

**Option 1 (Focus on methodology and interpretation):**

> The Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade level serves as a quantitative metric for evaluating the linguistic complexity of user stories. This assessment is based on readability formulas calibrated to U.S. educational grade levels. Consequently, a higher F-K score indicates greater complexity, potentially necessitating a higher level of domain expertise or cognitive effort for reader comprehension. To illustrate factors influencing this metric, Table \ref{tab:readability2} presents the average words per story. This data point is relevant as sentence length, often correlated with the word count per story, constitutes a primary input variable in the F-K calculation methodology.

**Option 2 (More concise):**

> The Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade level formula provides a standardized assessment of user story readability, quantifying complexity relative to U.S. educational benchmarks. Higher F-K scores denote increased linguistic complexity, implying greater demands on reader expertise for comprehension. As shown in Table \ref{tab:readability2}, the average word count per story was examined, reflecting a key input (sentence length) used within the F-K computational logic to determine readability scores.

**Option 3 (Slightly more formal):**

> To analyze the complexity of user stories, the Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade level metric was employed. This tool assesses readability, assigning scores corresponding to U.S. educational grade levels, thereby offering a quantitative measure of linguistic difficulty. An elevated F-K grade level signifies a more complex user story, suggesting that greater expertise may be required for its accurate interpretation. In support of this analysis, Table \ref{tab:readability2} includes the calculated average words per story, a metric correlated with sentence length which is a fundamental component of the F-K readability algorithm.

**Key Changes Made (Common to all options):**

*   Replaced informal terms (""tool,"" ""shows the correlation"") with more formal vocabulary (""metric,"" ""quantitative measure,"" ""evaluating,"" ""assessing,"" ""indicates,"" ""constitutes,"" ""reflecting,"" ""correlated with"").
*   Used more precise language (""linguistic complexity,"" ""reader comprehension,"" ""computational logic/methodology/algorithm,"" ""domain expertise,"" ""cognitive effort"").
*   Improved sentence structure for better flow and formality.
*   Explicitly stated the relationship between F-K score, complexity, and required expertise.
*   Clarified *why* average words per story is relevant (related to sentence length input for F-K).
*   Ensured correct referencing of the table (`Table \ref{tab:readability2}`).

4,Summarize the tv show the oc,"Okay, here's a summary of the TV show *The O.C.*:

*The O.C.* was a popular American teen drama that aired from 2003 to 2007.

**Premise:**
The show centers around **Ryan Atwood**, a smart but troubled teenager from a broken home in Chino, California. After getting arrested, his public defender, the idealistic **Sandy Cohen**, takes pity on him and brings him home to live with his wealthy family in the affluent, picturesque community of Newport Beach, Orange County (The O.C.).

**Core Characters & Dynamics:**

*   **Ryan Atwood:** The perennial outsider trying to navigate the complex and often superficial world of Newport's elite while escaping his troubled past. He forms a brotherly bond with Seth and has a tumultuous romantic relationship with Marissa.
*   **Seth Cohen:** Sandy's nerdy, sarcastic, and pop-culture-obsessed son. He often felt like an outsider himself despite his wealth. Ryan's arrival gives him a much-needed friend and ally. He pursues a long-term relationship with Summer.
*   **Marissa Cooper:** The beautiful, privileged, but deeply troubled girl-next-door. She struggles with family issues, substance abuse, and relationship drama, becoming Ryan's primary love interest.
*   **Summer Roberts:** Marissa's best friend, initially portrayed as a shallow popular girl, but evolves into a more complex and caring character. She becomes Seth's main love interest.
*   **Sandy & Kirsten Cohen:** Seth's parents. Sandy is the morally grounded public defender (later private lawyer/businessman), often clashing with Newport's values. Kirsten comes from Newport wealth (her father is the ruthless developer Caleb Nichol) and struggles with the pressures of her background, work, and family, including alcoholism. They represent a (mostly) stable parental unit for the teens.

**Key Themes & Plot Points:**

*   **Culture Clash:** The stark contrast between Ryan's working-class background and the extreme wealth and privilege of Newport Beach is a central theme.
*   **Fish Out of Water:** Ryan's struggle to fit in and Seth's feeling of being an outsider within his own community.
*   **Family:** Explores both supportive family dynamics (the Cohens, mostly) and highly dysfunctional ones (the Coopers, the Nichols).
*   **Teen Romance & Drama:** Focuses heavily on the complex relationships, breakups, makeups, and love triangles of the core four (Ryan/Marissa, Seth/Summer).
*   **Secrets & Scandals:** The seemingly perfect lives of Newport residents often hide dark secrets, financial troubles, affairs, and betrayals.
*   **Coming of Age:** Follows the characters through high school, dealing with identity crises, friendships, first loves, heartbreak, and navigating the path to adulthood.

**Overall Vibe:**
*The O.C.* blended high-stakes soap opera drama with witty dialogue (especially from Seth), heartfelt moments, and a significant focus on contemporary indie rock music, which heavily influenced its style and popularity. It was known for its fast-paced plotting, attractive cast, and sun-drenched California setting. While critically acclaimed in its early seasons, it became increasingly melodramatic later on, particularly after a major character departure.

In short, *The O.C.* is about a troubled teen given a second chance in a wealthy community, exploring themes of class, family, love, and belonging amidst the drama and sunshine of Orange County.",non-search
5,Summarize the tv show the oc,"""The O.C."" is an American teen drama television series that aired on Fox for four seasons, from August 5, 2003, to February 22, 2007. Created by Josh Schwartz, the show is set in the affluent coastal community of Newport Beach in Orange County (The O.C.), California.

The series primarily revolves around Ryan Atwood (played by Ben McKenzie), a troubled teenager from a broken home in Chino. After being kicked out by his mother, Ryan is taken in by Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), a public defender, and his wife Kirsten Cohen (Kelly Rowan), a wealthy real estate developer. The Cohens adopt Ryan, bringing him into their lavish Newport Beach lifestyle.

A major theme throughout the series is the culture shock and class issues Ryan experiences as he navigates the superficial, high-class society of Newport Beach, contrasted with his background of poverty and domestic abuse. He quickly forms a strong bond with his adoptive brother, Seth Cohen (Adam Brody), who is portrayed as socially awkward, witty, and initially an outsider in the Newport social scene. Together, Ryan and Seth navigate life as outsiders in this privileged world.

Much of the drama centers on the relationships between the main characters:
*   **Ryan Atwood:** The protagonist trying to fit into a new world while dealing with his past. He develops an on-and-off romantic relationship with Marissa Cooper.
*   **Seth Cohen:** The Cohens' nerdy son who has a long-standing crush on Summer Roberts. He navigates newfound popularity and romantic entanglements, including a love triangle with Summer and Anna Stern.
*   **Marissa Cooper:** (played by Mischa Barton, seasons 1–3) The girl next door and Ryan's primary love interest, who struggles with various personal and family issues.
*   **Summer Roberts:** (played by Rachel Bilson) Marissa's best friend and Seth's love interest, who evolves from a seemingly shallow popular girl into a more complex character.
*   **Sandy and Kirsten Cohen:** The idealistic parents who provide a moral compass and a stable home for Ryan and Seth, while navigating their own marital and professional challenges.

The storylines explore typical teen drama themes like relationships, family crises, love triangles, sex, substance abuse, mental health, and social dynamics within the wealthy community. The show contrasts the idealistic Cohen family with the often shallow and materialistic attitudes of their neighbors. It functions as a blend of melodrama, comedy, and social commentary, sometimes satirizing the privileged environment it depicts.

""The O.C."" gained significant popularity, particularly among teenagers and young adults, becoming known for its storylines, humor, character development, and influence on fashion and music, notably featuring many alternative rock bands. The show ran for 92 episodes across four seasons.",search

Хотел бы поднять вопрос о планировании задач нашей команды на текущий квартал, сфокусировавшись на направлении интернет-эквайринга.

14,how many r in srierr harben bruckkerr gesprengt,"Based on the search results, here's what can be found regarding fatalities related to bridge incidents in Sierre and Harburg:

**Sierre (Switzerland):**

*   There is no information about a bridge being bombed (""gesprengt"") in Sierre leading to fatalities.
*   The most significant fatal incident associated with Sierre is the **Sierre coach crash in 2012**. This happened in the **Sierre Tunnel**, not on a bridge. A coach carrying schoolchildren and teachers crashed into a tunnel wall. **28 people were killed** in this accident: 22 children, 4 teachers, and both drivers.

**Harburg (likely Hamburg-Harburg, Germany):**

*   There is no specific mention of a bridge in Harburg being bombed (""gesprengt"") resulting in deaths in recent times.
*   Searches mention historical contexts:
    *   During the end of **World War II**, there were discussions and actions related to blowing up bridges near Harburg (like in Jesteburg nearby) to hinder advancing Allied forces, but the sources found don't mention fatalities specifically from these bridge demolitions, although houses were damaged.
    *   Historical reports mention many deaths during transports of prisoners near Harburg towards the end of WWII, but not directly linked to a bridge bombing.
*   General bridge incidents:
    *   There are mentions of fatal train accidents in the Hamburg area, some involving bridges, but not bombings. For example, a train collision near a Hamburg suburban station reportedly killed 11 people and injured 70 (date not specified in snippet but likely historical).
    *   There are general lists of bridge collapses worldwide, but no prominent recent case linked to a bombing in Harburg with fatalities stands out.
    *   A fatal motorbike accident occurred at an intersection involving Harburg Drive in Beenleigh, Queensland, Australia (unrelated to Harburg, Germany).

**Other Locations Mentioned (possible confusion):**

*   **Sierra Leone:** Several fatal bridge incidents occurred here, including the King Jimmy Bridge collapse due to a landslide (around 15 deaths in 2013), the Mathehun Bridge collapse (no fatalities, only injuries in 2024), and an accident on the Rogbere Bridge (3 deaths in 2017). These are unrelated to Sierre, Switzerland.

**In summary:**

*   **Sierre:** 28 people died in the 2012 *tunnel* coach crash, not a bridge bombing.
*   **Harburg:** No information found about fatalities from a specific bridge *bombing*. Historical bridge demolitions occurred during WWII, but associated death tolls are not specified in the results. Other fatal accidents involving trains or vehicles have occurred in the greater Hamburg area, sometimes near bridges.

It seems the premise of bridges being bombed (""gesprengt"") in Sierre and Harburg causing specific numbers of deaths is not supported by readily available information. The Sierre incident likely refers to the well-known tunnel tragedy.",search

ダーウィンの理論は、進化が2つの要因の作用によってもたらされたというものでした。

第一の要因は遺伝です。これは、子孫が親にほぼ似るようにする原理でありながら、「変種（sporting）」、すなわち偶然の変異（多くは非常にわずかな変異で、大きな変異はまれ）が起こる余地も残すものです。

第二の要因は、出生率を死亡率の水準に保つことができない品種や種（しゅ）が絶滅することです。

このダーウィンの原理は、明らかに広く一般化することが可能です。すなわち、特定の形質を変化させずに保持する傾向を持つ対象が多数存在し、しかしその傾向は絶対的ではなく偶然の変異の余地があり、そして、もしその変異の量が特定の方向において、その限界に達するすべてのものの破壊によって絶対的に制限されるならば、それらの限界から離れる方向へと徐々に変化していく傾向が生じるでしょう。

例えば、もし百万人のプレイヤーが公平なゲームで賭けを始めると、次々と破産していくため、残ったプレイヤーの平均的な富は永続的に増加していくでしょう。

ここには、その作用が動植物種の発展において多くを説明するか、わずかしか説明しないかにかかわらず、疑いなく、起こり得る進化の真の公式が存在するのです。

Я очень одинокий человек, у меня никого нет. С Ваней у нас очень непростые отношения, про которые я почти точно уверена, что они закончатся. По очень многим причинам скажем так но сейчас не время не время расставаться скажем так вот ну и как бы бывают какие-то хорошие моменты когда мы говорим про будущего ребенка скорее такие семейные какие-то добрые моменты Да а если надо серьезно что-то поговорить, у нас не получается. Вот про то, как всё с ребёнком будет, как там бюджет, как будет устроена наша жизнь и так далее, вот на серьёзные темы не получается разговаривать. А что-нибудь миленькое, там, ну, там у нас имя уже есть, там всё, ну, чего-нибудь вот доброе, милое там. Это да, это у нас бывает. Вот. Ну, поэтому сложно. Но так как я очень переживаю про то, как оно всё будет, то, конечно, важно вести... Ну, в общем, короче, не просто с вами. Это я сейчас тебе так рассказываю. А, в общем-то, это как бы крайне сложные мои чувства. Крайне сложные, что, по сути, это мой единственный близкий человек. Но, как бы сказать, вопросов, недовольств, недовольствованности отношений у меня море. А теперь это ещё и отец ребёнка, то есть у нас общий ребёнок. Вот, короче, всё непросто. И на самом деле вот ближе к концу марта у меня вообще как-то, ну, то есть месяц апрель я оцениваю как достаточно счастливый месяц в моей жизни. Вот, мы там снова заобщались вот со старой подружкой Наташкой моей Ну потому что с большим ни с кем не общаемся там А ну там прекрасная история с Анкой произошла я может быть как-нибудь отдельно тебе расскажу просто задолбалась об этом рассказывать она кстати вот в январе еще из Анки много плакала Ну в общем ф общем, фактически она мне предала, конечно. То есть она мне не отдала долг. И, короче, как бы крайне-крайне странно себя повела. Но я уже про неё не думаю давно. Она работала до сих пор у Вани, но её уволили в итоге. В общем, я ничего про неё не знаю, она заблокирована. Фигня в том, что у меня потерялись все друзья, в общем-то, все, кто у меня был, у меня потерялись. То есть моя главная сила и опора, которая была в друзьях, да, там на момент ещё 5 лет назад, там 4 года назад, ну, как бы На момент еще 5 лет назад, 4 года назад. Я была про друзей очень сильной, про тусовки, про общение, что меня наполняло, давало очень много ресурсов. Этот ресурс ушел полностью, совсем. Этого нет больше вообще. Последние 2 года этого нет вообще в моей жизни. Ресурсы друзей и общения. Я ни с кем не общаюсь но я не работаю как бы куда уже работать до под через четыре месяца вроде бы вроде бы я должна родить я очень надеюсь что это произойдет вот просто рассказывайте свою жизнь не знаю почему тебя сложно меня понимать. Кстати, вот тоже расскажи, почему тебе сложно меня понимать. Я не знаю. Я не понимаю, в чем меня сложно понимать. Мне кажется, я очень понятная. Ну, то есть понятно, что мы с тобой совершенно не общаемся. Понятно, как бы тогда, о чем речь-то вообще, кого понимать, если мы даже не общаемся. Ну, не знаю, а когда мы с тобой много общались, там, в 15-м году, 10 лет назад, ты меня понимал или тоже не понимал? Ну, понятно, что если как бы так не общаться, как сейчас, то и ничего. Более того, ну вот на что я там обиделась на тебя, я написала. Я как бы всегда готова прояснять чувства. Для меня это очень большая ценность. Я, кстати, недавно проходила курс... Да, я помню твои, мягко скажем, непростые отношения с Марьяной Олейник, но я ее прежнего очень люблю, и люблю ее курсы, и подкасты. И вот я покупала у нее курс про дружбу, большой такой, знаешь, на месяц, и проходила. Очень-очень, как сказать, ценно, но двояко, потому что мне практически не с кем это практиковать. Ну, может быть, на будущее. Но там очень много... Это же дружба, ну, как бы это же вообще про отношения. То есть про то, как предъявлять всякие обиды, непонятки, вот как быть в конфликте с друзьями. В общем, там много интересного. Про всякие детско-родительские переносы и так далее. Очень много интересного. Я его переслушиваю эти аудио снова и снова. Ну, короче, хочу сказать, что в апреле было много клёвого. Я тут так офигенно сходила недавно на одно занятие, на женский круг вот я хожу, ну там такие соматические всякие занятия, мне было там офигенно, хотя я чувствую себя довольно плохо все время, у меня вообще странные симптомы там по беременности, вот, но если я все-таки сюда себя как куда-то вытащу, вот куда-то я там конечно по такой погоде гуляю мы понимаешь но я надеюсь что мы скоро переедем это я мы должны были переехать то есть мы нашли там в январе покупатель должны были приехать но до конца марта но как бы мы их потеряли по определенным причинам не от нас завище и потом мы срочно нашли еще других покупателей, поэтому… Которые тоже там задерживали и уже… Ой, просто как бы я хотела там, знаешь, я хотела до Майя переехать точно, ну, потому что я хочу гулять в Овраге, да, в моем… Ну, у нас, кстати, будет квартира, которая прямо рядом с оврагом, если ты помнишь. То есть там дом прямо выходит на овраг, практически он вдоль оврага стоит. И к папе тоже очень близко мне будет ходить. Ну, мы тоже с Ваней. Это тоже было непросто, как мы смотрели эти квартиры, ездили, смотрели на Циане. Но это было даже прикольно, но довольно нервно, и у нас ещё несколько разные тоже, как сказать, разные критерии того, что нам нужно, квартиры. Ему там близко к метро важно, да, ну и просто сама квартира как-то у нас немножко по-разному, взгляд. Но всё-таки мы как-то более-менее сошлись там на одном варианте. Вот мы её купили, это очень тревожно, очень нервно, завтра, завтра мы будем её получать. То есть нам передадут ключи, там подпишем акт, передадут ключи, все. И мы там запустим ремонт, но небольшой ремонт, он должен дней 10, я надеюсь, не больше происходить. Вот завтра же мы встречаемся с мастером на квартире, и я надеюсь, что за 10 дней он сделает этот ремонт, и мы потом сразу переедем. Но мы переезжать будем с фирмой. Тоже сейчас надо будет позвать менеджера, который оценит. Мы уже, знаешь, рисовали планы. Ваня измерял, как мебель куда въедет. То есть, какая мебель войдет, какая не войдет. Это такое тоже непростое, конечно же, мероприятие. Еще, так как я беременная, как мне все это разгребать, потом разбирать, все эти коробки, тоже мы с Ваней про это ругались. Но это очень большое событие, важное, потому что, во-первых, да, еще плюс я дачу хочу купить с этой разницей квартир. Но это тоже отдельная тема, потому что я не могу без дачи, потому что Мишкину дачу покупает, ну, где я жила. Да, помнишь, последние два года я ездила вот на Мишкину дачу в Михнево. Ее покупает Эля, с которой мы в конфликте, то есть не общаемся. А мы решили, я решила купить как бы в другом поселке, собственно, в моем поселке дачу, потому что я понимаю, что я не могу летом без дачи, вот просто не могу. Ну просто потому что для меня это убийство в жару находиться в квартире, да, ну даже если овраг рядом все равно, то есть мне важно жить на природе. Ну вот, то есть, хотя это очень сложное решение, очень, потому что хочется же как-то сохранить, а там не так дешево получается, ну, в плане денежном, да. Там, в общем-то, как мы эту дачу купим, так и особо-то много денег не останется, с учетом того, что еще хочу на машину отложить на буду на будущее вот то что с ребенком конечно Ну и вообще как бы как будет устроена наша денежная отношения с вами для меня по-прежнему большой вопрос вот с ребенком потому что Ну я намерена все сейчас из своих денег тратить из этих вот из этой нескольких миллионов, да, ну вот. По сути, как мы купим дачу, останется примерно 3 миллиона, вот так вот. Ну, насколько это хватит, да, если с этих же денег жить, да, и будет ли давать Ваня, тоже большой вопрос. Сложно. А что я вообще, ну, видишь, я просто рассказываю тебе про свою жизнь, не знаю. Вот. Почему ты меня не понимаешь? У меня прям такой этот вопрос. Я не понимаю. Мне кажется, я такая понятная. Я не понимаю, чего можно во мне не понять, если честно. Вот. Ну, особенно если общаться. Мы же были периоды у нас, когда мы более-менее взаимодействовали. Чего? Мне очень не хватает какого-то близкого регулярного общения с людьми. Мы сейчас немножечко как раз в апреле с подружкой моей однокурсницей, она моя Н моя наташа мы с ней стали регулярно знаешь каждый день там обмениваться мне вот важно хоть с кем-то потому что он за тоже перестала мне доверять ну короче мне какая-то прошлую осень просто трешатина вышла со всеми подругами по роста полное и это конечно крайне тяжело, поскольку у меня были, ну, проблемы со здоровьем были и вообще. И вообще в жизни всё очень сильно непросто. Ну, и почти всё время плохо себя чувствую. Ещё до беременности. Сейчас-то как бы это всё можно объяснить, скажем так, беременностью, да. Хотя я понимаю, что далеко не всё это объяснимо беременностью да хотя я понимаю что далеко не все это объяснимо беременность в темой самочувствие да скорее это просто моё изначально плохое самочувствие наложилось теперь еще что ребенок внутри до отъедает мои ресурсы вот короче про вчера сложился с ну большой стресс вот чтобы пришлось вечером ехать срываться блин по час пику в этот центральный там mvc потом банка я ну как бы мне это все непросто и я не там еще отношение этих риэлторш такое, ну, короче, вопросы есть, то есть я начала психовать просто от усталости, от стресса, от центра Москвы, вот это все, что там эти все... непросто мне все это уже дается, и дальше мы как-то с Ваней начали, ну, тут, если на свежую голову посмотреть... В общем, короче, мне в итоге стало плохо уже дома, уже когда мы пришли домой. Что-то он мне там сказал плохое. В итоге я как бы разрывалась, впала в травму и стала очень прям горько плакать. А он меня как бы не поддерживал, не подходил ко мне. И эти истерики у меня, ну, длились очень долго. Это самое жуткое состояние. Это абсолютная ядерная война вообще. То есть когда еще человек к тебе не подходит, тебя не обнимает. Но в итоге под конец только он там же меня обнял и как-то ладно. Но в целом это чистое попадание в травму. Это, конечно, не каждый день происходит, но это может происходить со мной. И против этого у меня нет. Это состояние младенца под забором. Опять же, конечно, оно не каждый день. Но моя мама вот так вот жила последние годы, да, в таком состоянии. И я сейчас её гораздо лучше понимаю, чем я её раньше понимала. Во всём, во многом. Вот я на кладбище к ней прихожу. Ладно, что-то я тебе очень много рассказываю. Ну, если ты хочешь, ты можешь, что-то я тебе очень много рассказываю. Ну, если ты хочешь, ты можешь тоже что-нибудь мне записать. Вот. Буду рада.

---

**1. Стресс из-за сделки с квартирами и ожидания денег**

Мы сейчас продаем квартиру. Мы, собственно, в субботу продали квартиру. Вчера там был нервный день, потому что надо было весь день ждать, ехать — не ехать в МФЦ и в банк, в центр вместе с двумя риелторами, чтобы, короче, забирать там бумажки, ЕГРН на квартиры (потому что мы и продаем, и покупаем) и раскрывать аккредитив, это называется, получать средства. Я получаю какую-то разницу с квартир. Это надо было весь день... Ждала просто уведомления на Госуслугах, была на связи с риелторами. Это ничего такого, просто очень... Я специально рано проснулась, потому что нам это как можно быстрее нужно, потому что нам нужно быстрее начать ремонт на нашей новой квартире, потому что уже, блин, май, а мы с сентября это всё продаем.

**2. Течение беременности: трудности, скрининги и переживания**

Вот, и как бы, так как я уже на почти шестом месяце... Я не знаю, после вчера там вообще осталось что-то живое. Вот, у меня скрининг будет в пятницу, второй скрининг уже. В беременности есть первый, второй, третий скрининги. Да, вот за беременность основные УЗИ. Вот у меня в пятницу будет, потому что уже 20 недель сейчас у меня. Вот. И вчера, конечно, жесть. То есть, но это было нервно, очень нервно, очень просто много нервных моментов.
В целом-то у меня сейчас достаточно не стрессовая жизнь, она может быть местами депрессивная. Ну, там еще зимой... Нам осенью, зимой... Мне осенью плохо очень себя чувствовала, потом был очень сильный токсикоз. То есть январь я очень сильно нервничала: там растет ли ребенок, растет ли что? И там далеко не сразу это было понятно, и было такое, что я была практически уверена, что будет биохимическая беременность или замершая, потому что было очень маленькое ХГЧ сначала, потом очень маленькое плодное яйцо. Короче, ну, всё росло как-то очень медленно и очень маленького размера, и не соответствовало нормам. То есть я ужасно переживала, что ничего не получится.
Вот, потом с конца января меня начало тошнить, где-то с последней недели января. Жутко тошнить. Тошнило, ну, месяц где-то меня злостно тошнило. То есть был реальный такой токсикоз, но не рвало, нет. Пару раз вырвало, но прямо тошнило, прямо, прямо вот как описывают. Вот. То есть я могла только валяться, ну, и слабость дикая.
Потом, в принципе, март. Казалось бы, уже я вышла из токсикоза, да, примерно там в марте, в начале марта. 7 марта был скрининг первый, там было всё хорошо, я была страшно счастлива.

**3. Сложные отношения с Ваней и будущее родительство**

Вот, но там были очень тяжёлые моменты. Ну, я очень много плакала в марте. Там был ещё этот коридор затмений, не знаю, связано или нет, но я там из-за взаимодействия с Элей очень много... У нас было очень сложное взаимодействие, я впадала в истерику, наверное. Ну, моё, блин, пограничное расстройство плюс беременность дают... ну, как бы, это очень большая уязвимость.
Я очень одинокий человек, у меня никого нет. С Ваней у нас очень непростые отношения, про которые я почти точно уверена, что они закончатся. По очень многим причинам, скажем так. Но сейчас не время, не время расставаться, скажем так. Вот. Ну и как бы, бывают какие-то хорошие моменты, когда мы говорим про будущего ребенка, скорее такие семейные какие-то добрые моменты, да. А если надо серьезно что-то поговорить, у нас не получается. Вот про то, как всё с ребёнком будет, как там бюджет, как будет устроена наша жизнь и так далее — вот на серьёзные темы не получается разговаривать. А что-нибудь миленькое, там, ну, там у нас имя уже есть, там всё, ну, чего-нибудь вот доброе, милое — там это да, это у нас бывает. Вот. Ну, поэтому сложно.
Но так как я очень переживаю про то, как оно всё будет, то, конечно, важно вести... Ну, в общем, короче, не просто с Ваней. Это я сейчас тебе так рассказываю. А в общем-то, это как бы крайне сложные мои чувства. Крайне сложные, что, по сути, это мой единственный близкий человек. Но, как бы сказать, вопросов, недовольств, неудовлетворенности отношениями у меня море. А теперь это ещё и отец ребёнка, то есть у нас общий ребёнок. Вот, короче, всё непросто.

**4. Потеря друзей, одиночество и поиск ресурса**

И на самом деле, вот ближе к концу марта у меня вообще как-то... Ну, то есть месяц апрель я оцениваю как достаточно счастливый месяц в моей жизни. Вот, мы там снова заобщались вот со старой подружкой Наташкой моей. Ну, потому что с большинством ни с кем не общаемся там. А, ну, там прекрасная история с Анкой произошла, я, может быть, как-нибудь отдельно тебе расскажу, просто задолбалась об этом рассказывать. Она, кстати, вот в январе еще... Из-за Анки много плакала. Ну, в общем, фактически она меня предала, конечно. То есть она мне не отдала долг. И, короче, как бы крайне-крайне странно себя повела. Но я уже про неё не думаю давно. Она работала до сих пор у Вани, но её уволили в итоге. В общем, я ничего про неё не знаю, она заблокирована.
Фигня в том, что у меня потерялись все друзья, в общем-то. Все, кто у меня был, у меня потерялись. То есть моя главная сила и опора, которая была в друзьях, да, там на момент ещё 5 лет назад, там 4 года назад... Я была про друзей очень сильна, про тусовки, про общение, что меня наполняло, давало очень много ресурсов. Этот ресурс ушел полностью, совсем. Этого нет больше вообще. Последние 2 года этого нет вообще в моей жизни. Ресурса друзей и общения. Я ни с кем не общаюсь.
Но я не работаю, как бы, куда уже работать-то, через четыре месяца вроде бы я должна родить. Я очень надеюсь, что это произойдет.

**5. Вопрос о взаимопонимании и курс про дружбу**

Вот просто рассказываю свою жизнь, не знаю, почему тебе сложно меня понимать. Кстати, вот тоже расскажи, почему тебе сложно меня понимать. Я не знаю. Я не понимаю, в чем меня сложно понимать. Мне кажется, я очень понятная. Ну, то есть понятно, что мы с тобой совершенно не общаемся. Понятно, как бы, тогда о чем речь-то вообще, кого понимать, если мы даже не общаемся. Ну, не знаю. А когда мы с тобой много общались, там, в 15-м году, 10 лет назад, ты меня понимал или тоже не понимал? Ну, понятно, что если как бы так не общаться, как сейчас, то и ничего...
Более того, ну вот, на что я там обиделась на тебя, я написала. Я как бы всегда готова прояснять чувства. Для меня это очень большая ценность. Я, кстати, недавно проходила курс... Да, я помню твои, мягко скажем, непростые отношения с Марьяной Олейник, но я ее по-прежнему очень люблю, и люблю ее курсы, и подкасты. И вот я покупала у нее курс про дружбу, большой такой, знаешь, на месяц, и проходила. Очень-очень, как сказать, ценно, но двояко, потому что мне практически не с кем это практиковать. Ну, может быть, на будущее. Но там очень много... Это же дружба, ну, как бы, это же вообще про отношения. То есть про то, как предъявлять всякие обиды, непонятки, вот как быть в конфликте с друзьями. В общем, там много интересного. Про всякие детско-родительские переносы и так далее. Очень много интересного. Я его переслушиваю, эти аудио, снова и снова.

**6. Апрель: Позитивные моменты и самочувствие**

Ну, короче, хочу сказать, что в апреле было много клёвого. Я тут так офигенно сходила недавно на одно занятие, на женский круг вот я хожу. Ну, там такие соматические всякие занятия, мне было там офигенно. Хотя я чувствую себя довольно плохо все время, у меня вообще странные симптомы там по беременности. Вот, но если я все-таки себя как-то куда-то вытащу, вот куда-то... Я там, конечно, по такой погоде гуляю, мы... Понимаешь?

**7. Покупка новой квартиры: Поиск, критерии и планы на переезд/ремонт**

Но я надеюсь, что мы скоро переедем. Это... Мы должны были переехать... То есть мы нашли там в январе покупателей, должны были переехать до конца марта, но как бы мы их потеряли по определенным причинам, не от нас зависящим. И потом мы срочно нашли еще других покупателей, поэтому… Которые тоже там задерживали и уже… Ой, просто как бы я хотела там, знаешь, я хотела до мая переехать точно. Ну, потому что я хочу гулять в овраге, да, в моем… Ну, у нас, кстати, будет квартира, которая прямо рядом с оврагом, если ты помнишь. То есть там дом прямо выходит на овраг, практически он вдоль оврага стоит. И к папе тоже очень близко мне будет ходить.
Ну, мы тоже с Ваней... Это тоже было непросто, как мы смотрели эти квартиры, ездили, смотрели на ЦИАНе. Но это было даже прикольно, но довольно нервно, и у нас ещё несколько разные тоже, как сказать, разные критерии того, что нам нужно от квартиры. Ему там близко к метро важно, да, ну и просто сама квартира — как-то у нас немножко по-разному взгляд. Но всё-таки мы как-то более-менее сошлись там на одном варианте. Вот мы её купили.
Это очень тревожно, очень нервно. Завтра, завтра мы будем её получать. То есть нам передадут ключи, там подпишем акт, передадут ключи, все. И мы там запустим ремонт, но небольшой ремонт, он должен дней 10, я надеюсь, не больше происходить. Вот завтра же мы встречаемся с мастером на квартире, и я надеюсь, что за 10 дней он сделает этот ремонт, и мы потом сразу переедем. Но мы переезжать будем с фирмой. Тоже сейчас надо будет позвать менеджера, который оценит. Мы уже, знаешь, рисовали планы. Ваня измерял, как мебель куда въедет. То есть, какая мебель войдет, какая не войдет. Это такое тоже непростое, конечно же, мероприятие. Еще, так как я беременная, как мне все это разгребать, потом разбирать, все эти коробки... Тоже мы с Ваней про это ругались.

**8. Планы на покупку дачи и финансовые вопросы**

Но это очень большое событие, важное, потому что, во-первых, да, еще плюс я дачу хочу купить с этой разницы с квартир. Но это тоже отдельная тема, потому что я не могу без дачи. Потому что Мишкину дачу покупает... ну, где я жила, да, помнишь, последние два года я ездила вот на Мишкину дачу в Михнево... ее покупает Эля, с которой мы в конфликте, то есть не общаемся. А мы решили, я решила купить как бы в другом поселке, собственно, в моем поселке дачу, потому что я понимаю, что я не могу летом без дачи, вот просто не могу. Ну, просто потому что для меня это убийство — в жару находиться в квартире, да? Ну, даже если овраг рядом, все равно. То есть мне важно жить на природе. Ну вот.
То есть, хотя это очень сложное решение, очень, потому что хочется же как-то сохранить... А там не так дешево получается, ну, в плане денежном, да. Там, в общем-то, как мы эту дачу купим, так и особо-то много денег не останется. С учетом того, что еще хочу на машину отложить на будущее. Вот то, что с ребенком, конечно... Ну и вообще как бы, как будут устроены наши денежные отношения с Ваней, для меня по-прежнему большой вопрос. Вот с ребенком. Потому что, ну, я намерена все сейчас из своих денег тратить, из этих вот, из этой разницы нескольких миллионов, да, ну вот. По сути, как мы купим дачу, останется примерно 3 миллиона, вот так вот. Ну, насколько этого хватит, да, если с этих же денег жить? Да, и будет ли давать Ваня — тоже большой вопрос. Сложно.

**9. Снова о непонимании и нехватке общения**

А что я вообще... Ну, видишь, я просто рассказываю тебе про свою жизнь, не знаю. Вот. Почему ты меня не понимаешь? У меня прям такой этот вопрос. Я не понимаю. Мне кажется, я такая понятная. Я не понимаю, чего можно во мне не понять, если честно. Вот. Ну, особенно если общаться. Мы же были периоды у нас, когда мы более-менее взаимодействовали. Чего?
Мне очень не хватает какого-то близкого регулярного общения с людьми. Мы сейчас немножечко как раз в апреле с подружкой моей однокурсницей, она моя... эмм... моя Наташа, мы с ней стали регулярно, знаешь, каждый день там обмениваться. Мне вот важно хоть с кем-то, потому что... Он [Ваня?] тоже перестал мне доверять, ну, короче... У меня какая-то прошлая осень просто трешатина вышла со всеми подругами, просто полная. И это, конечно, крайне тяжело, поскольку у меня были, ну, проблемы со здоровьем были и вообще. И вообще в жизни всё очень сильно непросто.
Ну, и почти всё время плохо себя чувствую. Ещё до беременности. Сейчас-то как бы это всё можно объяснить, скажем так, беременностью, да. Хотя я понимаю, что далеко не все это объяснимо беременностью, тема самочувствия, да. Скорее, это просто моё изначально плохое самочувствие, наложилось теперь еще, что ребенок внутри, да, отъедает мои ресурсы.

**10. Вчерашний срыв: Стресс, ссора с Ваней и попадание в травму**

Вот, короче, про вчера. Сложился большой стресс вот, что пришлось вечером ехать, срываться, блин, по час пику в этот центральный там МФЦ, потом банк. Я, ну, как бы мне это все непросто. И я не... там еще отношение этих риелторш такое... Ну, короче, вопросы есть. То есть я начала психовать просто от усталости, от стресса, от центра Москвы, вот это все, что там эти все... Непросто мне все это уже дается.
И дальше мы как-то с Ваней начали... Ну, тут, если на свежую голову посмотреть... В общем, короче, мне в итоге стало плохо уже дома, уже когда мы пришли домой. Что-то он мне там сказал плохое. В итоге я как бы разрыдалась, впала в травму и стала очень прям горько плакать. А он меня как бы не поддерживал, не подходил ко мне. И эти истерики у меня, ну, длились очень долго. Это самое жуткое состояние. Это абсолютная ядерная война вообще. То есть когда еще человек к тебе не подходит, тебя не обнимает. Но в итоге под конец только он там уже меня обнял и как-то... ладно. Но в целом это чистое попадание в травму. Это, конечно, не каждый день происходит, но это может происходить со мной. И против этого у меня нет... Это состояние младенца под забором. Опять же, конечно, оно не каждый день.

**11. Размышления о своем состоянии, матери и приглашение к диалогу**

Но моя мама вот так вот жила последние годы, да, в таком состоянии. И я сейчас её гораздо лучше понимаю, чем я её раньше понимала. Во всём, во многом. Вот я на кладбище к ней прихожу.
Ладно, что-то я тебе очень много рассказываю. Ну, если ты хочешь, ты можешь тоже что-нибудь мне записать. Вот. Буду рада.

Это ничего такого, просто очень я специально рано проснулась, потому что нам это как можно быстрее нужно, потому что нам нужно быстрее начать ремонт на нашей новой квартире, потому что уже, блин, майский, мы с сентября это все продаем, вот, и как бы, так как я уже на почти шестом месяце, я не знаю, после вчера там вообще осталось что-то живое, вот, у меня скрининг будет в пятницу, я второй скрининг уже, в беременности есть первый скрининг, второй, три скрининг будет в пятницу я второй скрининг уже в беременность есть первый скрин второй три скрининга да вот за беременность основные узи вот у меня в пятницу будет потому уже 20 недели сейчас у меня вот и корну вчера конечно жесть то есть но это было нервно очень нерв очень просто много нервных моментов в целом-то у меня сейчас достаточно не стрессовая жизнь она может быть местами депрессивная ну там еще там еще зимой но осенью зимой нам осенью плохо очень себя чувствовала потом не было очень сильный токсико то есть январь я очень сильно нервничала, там растет ли ребенок, растет ли что, и там далеко не сразу это было понятно, и было такое, что я была практически уверена, что будет биохимическая беременность или замерзшая, потому что было очень маленькое ХГЧ сначала, потом очень маленькое плодное яйцо короче Ну всё росло как-то очень медленный очень маленького размера и не соответствовал нормам то есть я ужасно переживала что это ничего не получится вот потом с конца января мне начало тошнить где-то последние недели января жутко тошнить тошнила Ну месяц где-то меня же злостно тошнило то есть был реальный такой токсикоз но не рвал он нет пару раз вырвала но прям точно прям прям вот как описывают вот то есть я могла только валяться ну и слабость дико потом в принципе март казалось бы уже у я вышла уже из токсикоза, да, примерно там в марте, в начале марта. 7 марта был скрининг первый, там было всё хорошо, я была страшно счастлива. Вот, но там были очень тяжёлые моменты, ну, я очень много плакала в марте, там был ещё этот коридор затмения, не знаю, связано или нет, но я там из-за взаимодействия с Элей очень много, у нас было очень сложное взаимодействие, я впадала в истерику, наверное, ну, мое, блин, пограничное расстройство плюс беременность, ну, дает как бы не, то есть это очень большая уязвимость. Я очень одинокий человек, у меня никого нет. С Ваней у нас очень непростые отношения, про которые я почти точно уверена, что они закончатся. По очень многим причинам скажем так но сейчас не время не время расставаться скажем так вот ну и как бы бывают какие-то хорошие моменты когда мы говорим про будущего ребенка скорее такие семейные какие-то добрые моменты Да а если надо серьезно что-то поговорить, у нас не получается. Вот про то, как всё с ребёнком будет, как там бюджет, как будет устроена наша жизнь и так далее, вот на серьёзные темы не получается разговаривать. А что-нибудь миленькое, там, ну, там у нас имя уже есть, там всё, ну, чего-нибудь вот доброе, милое там. Это да, это у нас бывает. Вот. Ну, поэтому сложно. Но так как я очень переживаю про то, как оно всё будет, то, конечно, важно вести... Ну, в общем, короче, не просто с вами. Это я сейчас тебе так рассказываю. А, в общем-то, это как бы крайне сложные мои чувства. Крайне сложные, что, по сути, это мой единственный близкий человек. Но, как бы сказать, вопросов, недовольств, недовольствованности отношений у меня море. А теперь это ещё и отец ребёнка, то есть у нас общий ребёнок. Вот, короче, всё непросто. И на самом деле вот ближе к концу марта у меня вообще как-то, ну, то есть месяц апрель я оцениваю как достаточно счастливый месяц в моей жизни. Вот, мы там снова заобщались вот со старой подружкой Наташкой моей Ну потому что с большим ни с кем не общаемся там А ну там прекрасная история с Анкой произошла я может быть как-нибудь отдельно тебе расскажу просто задолбалась об этом рассказывать она кстати вот в январе еще из Анки много плакала Ну в общем ф общем, фактически она мне предала, конечно. То есть она мне не отдала долг. И, короче, как бы крайне-крайне странно себя повела. Но я уже про неё не думаю давно. Она работала до сих пор у Вани, но её уволили в итоге. В общем, я ничего про неё не знаю, она заблокирована. Фигня в том, что у меня потерялись все друзья, в общем-то, все, кто у меня был, у меня потерялись. То есть моя главная сила и опора, которая была в друзьях, да, там на момент ещё 5 лет назад, там 4 года назад, ну, как бы На момент еще 5 лет назад, 4 года назад. Я была про друзей очень сильной, про тусовки, про общение, что меня наполняло, давало очень много ресурсов. Этот ресурс ушел полностью, совсем. Этого нет больше вообще. Последние 2 года этого нет вообще в моей жизни. Ресурсы друзей и общения. Я ни с кем не общаюсь но я не работаю как бы куда уже работать до под через четыре месяца вроде бы вроде бы я должна родить я очень надеюсь что это произойдет вот просто рассказывайте свою жизнь не знаю почему тебя сложно меня понимать. Кстати, вот тоже расскажи, почему тебе сложно меня понимать. Я не знаю. Я не понимаю, в чем меня сложно понимать. Мне кажется, я очень понятная. Ну, то есть понятно, что мы с тобой совершенно не общаемся. Понятно, как бы тогда, о чем речь-то вообще, кого понимать, если мы даже не общаемся. Ну, не знаю, а когда мы с тобой много общались, там, в 15-м году, 10 лет назад, ты меня понимал или тоже не понимал? Ну, понятно, что если как бы так не общаться, как сейчас, то и ничего. Более того, ну вот на что я там обиделась на тебя, я написала. Я как бы всегда готова прояснять чувства. Для меня это очень большая ценность. Я, кстати, недавно проходила курс... Да, я помню твои, мягко скажем, непростые отношения с Марьяной Олейник, но я ее прежнего очень люблю, и люблю ее курсы, и подкасты. И вот я покупала у нее курс про дружбу, большой такой, знаешь, на месяц, и проходила. Очень-очень, как сказать, ценно, но двояко, потому что мне практически не с кем это практиковать. Ну, может быть, на будущее. Но там очень много... Это же дружба, ну, как бы это же вообще про отношения. То есть про то, как предъявлять всякие обиды, непонятки, вот как быть в конфликте с друзьями. В общем, там много интересного. Про всякие детско-родительские переносы и так далее. Очень много интересного. Я его переслушиваю эти аудио снова и снова. Ну, короче, хочу сказать, что в апреле было много клёвого. Я тут так офигенно сходила недавно на одно занятие, на женский круг вот я хожу, ну там такие соматические всякие занятия, мне было там офигенно, хотя я чувствую себя довольно плохо все время, у меня вообще странные симптомы там по беременности, вот, но если я все-таки сюда себя как куда-то вытащу, вот куда-то я там конечно по такой погоде гуляю мы понимаешь но я надеюсь что мы скоро переедем это я мы должны были переехать то есть мы нашли там в январе покупатель должны были приехать но до конца марта но как бы мы их потеряли по определенным причинам не от нас завище и потом мы срочно нашли еще других покупателей, поэтому… Которые тоже там задерживали и уже… Ой, просто как бы я хотела там, знаешь, я хотела до Майя переехать точно, ну, потому что я хочу гулять в Овраге, да, в моем… Ну, у нас, кстати, будет квартира, которая прямо рядом с оврагом, если ты помнишь. То есть там дом прямо выходит на овраг, практически он вдоль оврага стоит. И к папе тоже очень близко мне будет ходить. Ну, мы тоже с Ваней. Это тоже было непросто, как мы смотрели эти квартиры, ездили, смотрели на Циане. Но это было даже прикольно, но довольно нервно, и у нас ещё несколько разные тоже, как сказать, разные критерии того, что нам нужно, квартиры. Ему там близко к метро важно, да, ну и просто сама квартира как-то у нас немножко по-разному, взгляд. Но всё-таки мы как-то более-менее сошлись там на одном варианте. Вот мы её купили, это очень тревожно, очень нервно, завтра, завтра мы будем её получать. То есть нам передадут ключи, там подпишем акт, передадут ключи, все. И мы там запустим ремонт, но небольшой ремонт, он должен дней 10, я надеюсь, не больше происходить. Вот завтра же мы встречаемся с мастером на квартире, и я надеюсь, что за 10 дней он сделает этот ремонт, и мы потом сразу переедем. Но мы переезжать будем с фирмой. Тоже сейчас надо будет позвать менеджера, который оценит. Мы уже, знаешь, рисовали планы. Ваня измерял, как мебель куда въедет. То есть, какая мебель войдет, какая не войдет. Это такое тоже непростое, конечно же, мероприятие. Еще, так как я беременная, как мне все это разгребать, потом разбирать, все эти коробки, тоже мы с Ваней про это ругались. Но это очень большое событие, важное, потому что, во-первых, да, еще плюс я дачу хочу купить с этой разницей квартир. Но это тоже отдельная тема, потому что я не могу без дачи, потому что Мишкину дачу покупает, ну, где я жила. Да, помнишь, последние два года я ездила вот на Мишкину дачу в Михнево. Ее покупает Эля, с которой мы в конфликте, то есть не общаемся. А мы решили, я решила купить как бы в другом поселке, собственно, в моем поселке дачу, потому что я понимаю, что я не могу летом без дачи, вот просто не могу. Ну просто потому что для меня это убийство в жару находиться в квартире, да, ну даже если овраг рядом все равно, то есть мне важно жить на природе. Ну вот, то есть, хотя это очень сложное решение, очень, потому что хочется же как-то сохранить, а там не так дешево получается, ну, в плане денежном, да. Там, в общем-то, как мы эту дачу купим, так и особо-то много денег не останется, с учетом того, что еще хочу на машину отложить на буду на будущее вот то что с ребенком конечно Ну и вообще как бы как будет устроена наша денежная отношения с вами для меня по-прежнему большой вопрос вот с ребенком потому что Ну я намерена все сейчас из своих денег тратить из этих вот из этой нескольких миллионов, да, ну вот. По сути, как мы купим дачу, останется примерно 3 миллиона, вот так вот. Ну, насколько это хватит, да, если с этих же денег жить, да, и будет ли давать Ваня, тоже большой вопрос. Сложно. А что я вообще, ну, видишь, я просто рассказываю тебе про свою жизнь, не знаю. Вот. Почему ты меня не понимаешь? У меня прям такой этот вопрос. Я не понимаю. Мне кажется, я такая понятная. Я не понимаю, чего можно во мне не понять, если честно. Вот. Ну, особенно если общаться. Мы же были периоды у нас, когда мы более-менее взаимодействовали. Чего? Мне очень не хватает какого-то близкого регулярного общения с людьми. Мы сейчас немножечко как раз в апреле с подружкой моей однокурсницей, она моя Н моя наташа мы с ней стали регулярно знаешь каждый день там обмениваться мне вот важно хоть с кем-то потому что он за тоже перестала мне доверять ну короче мне какая-то прошлую осень просто трешатина вышла со всеми подругами по роста полное и это конечно крайне тяжело, поскольку у меня были, ну, проблемы со здоровьем были и вообще. И вообще в жизни всё очень сильно непросто. Ну, и почти всё время плохо себя чувствую. Ещё до беременности. Сейчас-то как бы это всё можно объяснить, скажем так, беременностью, да. Хотя я понимаю, что далеко не всё это объяснимо беременностью да хотя я понимаю что далеко не все это объяснимо беременность в темой самочувствие да скорее это просто моё изначально плохое самочувствие наложилось теперь еще что ребенок внутри до отъедает мои ресурсы вот короче про вчера сложился с ну большой стресс вот чтобы пришлось вечером ехать срываться блин по час пику в этот центральный там mvc потом банка я ну как бы мне это все непросто и я не там еще отношение этих риэлторш такое, ну, короче, вопросы есть, то есть я начала психовать просто от усталости, от стресса, от центра Москвы, вот это все, что там эти все... непросто мне все это уже дается, и дальше мы как-то с Ваней начали, ну, тут, если на свежую голову посмотреть... В общем, короче, мне в итоге стало плохо уже дома, уже когда мы пришли домой. Что-то он мне там сказал плохое. В итоге я как бы разрывалась, впала в травму и стала очень прям горько плакать. А он меня как бы не поддерживал, не подходил ко мне. И эти истерики у меня, ну, длились очень долго. Это самое жуткое состояние. Это абсолютная ядерная война вообще. То есть когда еще человек к тебе не подходит, тебя не обнимает. Но в итоге под конец только он там же меня обнял и как-то ладно. Но в целом это чистое попадание в травму. Это, конечно, не каждый день происходит, но это может происходить со мной. И против этого у меня нет. Это состояние младенца под забором. Опять же, конечно, оно не каждый день. Но моя мама вот так вот жила последние годы, да, в таком состоянии. И я сейчас её гораздо лучше понимаю, чем я её раньше понимала. Во всём, во многом. Вот я на кладбище к ней прихожу. Ладно, что-то я тебе очень много рассказываю. Ну, если ты хочешь, ты можешь, что-то я тебе очень много рассказываю. Ну, если ты хочешь, ты можешь тоже что-нибудь мне записать. Вот. Буду рада.

**1. Сделка с квартирой и связанный стресс**

Мы сейчас продаем квартиру. Мы, собственно, в субботу продали квартиру. Вчера там был нервный день, потому что надо было весь день ждать, ехать — не ехать в МФЦ и в банк, в центр вместе с двумя риэлторами, чтобы, короче, забирать там бумажки, ЕГРН на квартиры (потому что мы и продаем, и покупаем) и раскрывать аккредитив (это называется), получать средства. Я получаю какую-то разницу с квартиры. Это надо было [делать] весь день. Ждала просто уведомления на Госуслугах, была на связи с риэлторами. Это ничего такого, просто очень... я специально рано проснулась, потому что нам это как можно быстрее нужно, потому что нам нужно быстрее начать ремонт на нашей новой квартире, потому что уже, блин, майские, мы с сентября это все продаем.

**2. Беременность: обследования и самочувствие**

Вот, и как бы, так как я уже на почти шестом месяце... Я не знаю, после вчера там вообще осталось что-то живое. У меня скрининг будет в пятницу, второй скрининг уже. В беременности есть первый скрининг, второй, третий скрининг... да, вот за беременность основные УЗИ. Вот у меня в пятницу будет, потому что уже 20 недель сейчас у меня. Вот. И, короче, вчера, конечно, жесть. То есть, но это было нервно, очень нервно, очень просто много нервных моментов. В целом-то у меня сейчас достаточно не стрессовая жизнь, она может быть местами депрессивная. Ну, там еще... еще зимой... ну, осенью, зимой... Нам осенью [я] плохо очень себя чувствовала. Потом не было... очень сильный токсикоз. То есть январь я очень сильно нервничала: растет ли ребенок, растет ли что? И там далеко не сразу это было понятно, и было такое, что я была практически уверена, что будет биохимическая беременность или замершая, потому что было очень маленькое ХГЧ сначала, потом очень маленькое плодное яйцо. Короче, ну, всё росло как-то очень медленно и очень маленького размера и не соответствовало нормам. То есть я ужасно переживала, что ничего не получится. Вот. Потом с конца января меня начало тошнить, где-то с последней недели января. Жутко тошнить. Тошнило, ну, месяц где-то меня злостно тошнило, то есть был реальный такой токсикоз. Но не рвало, нет, пару раз вырвало, но прям тошнота прям-прям вот как описывают. То есть я могла только валяться, ну, и слабость дикая. Потом, в принципе, март... Казалось бы, уже я вышла из токсикоза, да, примерно там в марте, в начале марта. 7 марта был скрининг первый, там было всё хорошо, я была страшно счастлива. Вот.

**3. Отношения с Ваней**

Но там были очень тяжёлые моменты, ну, я очень много плакала в марте. Там был ещё этот коридор затмений, не знаю, связано или нет, но я там из-за взаимодействия с Элей очень много... у нас было очень сложное взаимодействие. Я впадала в истерику, наверное. Ну, мое, блин, пограничное расстройство плюс беременность, ну, дает как бы... то есть это очень большая уязвимость. Я очень одинокий человек, у меня никого нет. С Ваней у нас очень непростые отношения, про которые я почти точно уверена, что они закончатся. По очень многим причинам, скажем так. Но сейчас не время, не время расставаться, скажем так. Вот. Ну и как бы бывают какие-то хорошие моменты, когда мы говорим про будущего ребенка, скорее такие семейные какие-то добрые моменты, да. А если надо серьезно что-то поговорить, у нас не получается. Вот про то, как всё с ребёнком будет, как там бюджет, как будет устроена наша жизнь и так далее — вот на серьёзные темы не получается разговаривать. А что-нибудь миленькое, там, ну, там у нас имя уже есть, там всё... ну, чего-нибудь вот доброе, милое там — это да, это у нас бывает. Вот. Ну, поэтому сложно. Но так как я очень переживаю про то, как оно всё будет, то, конечно, важно вести... Ну, в общем, короче, не просто с Ваней. Это я сейчас тебе так рассказываю. А в общем-то, это как бы крайне сложные мои чувства. Крайне сложные, что, по сути, это мой единственный близкий человек. Но, как бы сказать, вопросов, недовольств, неудовлетворенности отношениями у меня море. А теперь это ещё и отец ребёнка, то есть у нас общий ребёнок. Вот, короче, всё непросто.

**4. Одиночество, потеря друзей и попытки наладить общение**

И на самом деле вот ближе к концу марта у меня вообще как-то... Ну то есть месяц апрель я оцениваю как достаточно счастливый месяц в моей жизни. Вот. Мы там снова начали общаться вот со старой подружкой Наташкой моей. Ну, потому что с больше ни с кем не общаемся там. А, ну там прекрасная история с Анкой произошла, я, может быть, как-нибудь отдельно тебе расскажу, просто задолбалась об этом рассказывать. Она, кстати... вот в январе еще из-за Анки много плакала. Ну, в общем... фактически она меня предала, конечно. То есть она мне не отдала долг. И, короче, как бы крайне-крайне странно себя повела. Но я уже про неё не думаю давно. Она работала до сих пор у Вани, но её уволили в итоге. В общем, я ничего про неё не знаю, она заблокирована.

Мы сейчас немножечко как раз в апреле с подружкой моей однокурсницей, она моя Наташа, мы с ней стали регулярно, знаешь, каждый день там обмениваться. Мне вот важно хоть с кем-то... потому что он [Ваня?] за... тоже перестала мне доверять? Ну, короче, у меня какая-то прошлую осень просто трешанина вышла со всеми подругами, просто полная. И это, конечно, крайне тяжело, поскольку у меня были, ну, проблемы со здоровьем были и вообще. И вообще в жизни всё очень сильно непросто.

**5. Курс про дружбу и отношения**

Я как бы всегда готова прояснять чувства. Для меня это очень большая ценность. Я, кстати, недавно проходила курс... Да, я помню твои, мягко скажем, непростые отношения с Марьяной Олейник, но я ее по-прежнему очень люблю, и люблю ее курсы, и подкасты. И вот я покупала у нее курс про дружбу, большой такой, знаешь, на месяц, и проходила. Очень-очень, как сказать, ценно, но двояко, потому что мне практически не с кем это практиковать.

В общем, там много интересного. Про всякие детско-родительские переносы и так далее. Очень много интересного. Я его переслушиваю, эти аудио, снова и снова.

**6. Планы на будущее: переезд, ремонт, дача и финансы**

Ну, короче, хочу сказать, что в апреле было много клёвого. Я тут так офигенно сходила недавно на одно занятие, на женский круг вот я хожу, ну там такие соматические всякие занятия, мне было там офигенно. Хотя я чувствую себя довольно плохо все время, у меня вообще странные симптомы там по беременности. Вот. Но если я все-таки себя как-то куда-то вытащу... Вот куда-то я там, конечно, по такой погоде гуляю... мы... Понимаешь, но я надеюсь, что мы скоро переедем. Это...

2.  **学术诚信：** 降重绝不等于洗稿或抄袭。即使经过改写，**凡是引用了他人的观点、数据、方法等，都必须进行规范的标注和引用**。降重是为了更好地融入你自己的论述，而不是掩盖来源。
3.  **降重 ≠ 简单替换词语：** 只替换同义词是最低效且最容易被查重系统识别的方法。高质量的降重需要**改变句子结构、调整语序、合并/拆分句子、进行概括转述**等。
4.  **理解是前提：** 在改写任何一段文字之前，你必须**完全理解**它的意思。只有理解了，才能用自己的话准确地重新表达。
5.  **查重系统：** 不同的查重系统（如知网、维普、万方、PaperPass、Turnitin等）有不同的算法和比对库。通常学校会指定使用哪种系统，最终结果以学校指定的系统为准。20%通常是一个比较常见的要求。

**请将你需要降重的文字发给我，我会尝试使用以下策略帮你进行改写：**

*   **改变句式：** 主动句改被动句，被动句改主动句，长句拆短句，短句合长句。
*   **替换词语：** 使用同义词、近义词或解释性词语替换原文中的词汇（注意保持学术性）。
*   **调整语序：** 改变句子中各部分的顺序。
*   **概括转述：** 用更简洁或不同的方式总结原文的核心信息。
*   **逻辑重组：** 在不改变原意的前提下，调整论述的逻辑顺序。

**请注意：**

*   我提供的改写版本是**基于我对原文的理解**进行的，你需要**仔细核对**是否仍然准确表达了你想要的意思。
*   改写后的文字**仍然需要你自己进行检查和润色**，确保其符合你的论文整体风格和语境。
*   对于引用部分，改写后**务必确认引用标注是否正确添加**。
*   最终的重复率需要**你自己通过学校指定的查重系统进行检测**。我无法保证在我这里改写后一定能低于20%，因为这取决于你原文的重复情况以及查重系统的具体判定。

    // EndIf
EndIf

Return lRet // Retorna .T. se válido, .F. se inválido
```

**Explicação:**

1.  **`VALID MeuValidTpFrete()`:** Quando o usuário sai do campo `C7_TPFRETE`, a função `MeuValidTpFrete` é chamada.
2.  **`MeuValidTpFrete( cValorAtual )`:** A função recebe o valor que o usuário *tentou* inserir (no caso do `TDialog`) ou pega o valor da variável `C7_TPFRETE` (no caso do `@ GET` padrão).
3.  **`If cValorAtual == ""S""`:** Verifica se o valor é ""S"".
4.  **Condição Adicional (Opcional):** Você pode adicionar um `IF` *dentro* dessa verificação se a restrição não for *sempre*, mas depender de outros campos ou condições.
5.  **`Help(...)` ou `Alert(...)`:** Exibe uma mensagem clara para o usuário explicando por que a opção ""S"" não é permitida.
6.  **`lRet := .F.`:** Define o retorno da função como Falso.
7.  **`Return lRet`:** Se a função retornar `.F.`, o Protheus impedirá que o usuário saia do campo com o valor ""S"" e manterá o foco no campo até que um valor válido seja inserido.

**Método 2: Validando em um Ponto de Entrada (Ex: Antes de Gravar)**

Se a restrição precisa ser verificada apenas no momento de salvar todo o registro (por exemplo, em um Pedido de Venda, Nota Fiscal), você pode usar um Ponto de Entrada apropriado (como `MTA120VLD`, `MTA410VLD`, `MT103VLD`, etc., dependendo da rotina).

```advpl
#Include ""Protheus.ch""

// Exemplo em um Ponto de Entrada de validação de linha (ex: MTA410VLD)
User Function MEUPONTOVALID() // Nome do seu ponto de entrada
Local nLinha := ParamIXB// Linha atual sendo validada
Local lRet   := .T.         // Assume válido

// Acessa o campo C7_TPFRETE da linha atual
// Use M->C7_TPFRETE se estiver no alias principal (SC7)
// Use Alias->C7_TPFRETE se estiver no alias correto (ex: SC7->C7_TPFRETE)
// Use AScan(aCols, {|x| AllTrim(x) == ""C7_TPFRETE""}) para achar a coluna em aCols se necessário

If (Alias)->C7_TPFRETE == ""S"" // Verifique o alias correto (SC7?)
   // ADICIONE AQUI A SUA CONDIÇÃO ESPECÍFICA PARA RESTRINGIR (se houver)
   // If (Alias)->C5_TIPO == ""F"" // Exemplo
   //    lRet := .F.
   //    PREVALIDA(lRet,""A opção 'S' não é permitida para este tipo de cliente."",Nil)
   // Else // Restringe sempre
      lRet := .F. // Falha na validação
      // Use a função PREVALIDA para retornar a mensagem de erro padrão do Protheus
      PREVALIDA(lRet,""A opção 'S' não é permitida para o Tipo de Frete."",Nil)
   // EndIf
EndIf

Return lRet // Retorna .T. se válido, .F. se inválido
```

**Método 3: Removendo a Opção ""S"" da Interface (Se Aplicável)**

Se o campo `C7_TPFRETE` for apresentado como um `COMBOBOX` ou `RADIO`, você pode filtrar a lista de opções para nem sequer mostrar o ""S"" sob certas condições.

```advpl
// Exemplo na definição de um ComboBox
Local aOpcoesTpFrete := {}
Local lPodeMostrarS := .T. // Lógica para definir se 'S' pode ser mostrado

// Exemplo: 'S' só pode ser mostrado se o cliente for Jurídico
// If C5_TIPO == ""J"" // Ou condição apropriada
//    lPodeMostrarS := .T.
// Else
//    lPodeMostrarS := .F.
// EndIf

// Adiciona as opções permitidas
AAdd(aOpcoesTpFrete, ""N=Não"") // Exemplo de opção
If lPodeMostrarS
   AAdd(aOpcoesTpFrete, ""S=Sim"")
EndIf
AAdd(aOpcoesTpFrete, ""T=Terceiros"") // Exemplo de outra opção

// Use aOpcoesTpFrete na definição do ComboBox
@ lin, col GET C7_TPFRETE COMBOBOX aOpcoesTpFrete PICTURE ""@!"" ... // Resto do GET
```

**Qual método escolher?**

*   **Método 1 (VALID do GET):** É o mais recomendado para validações imediatas na entrada de dados do usuário em um campo específico. Fornece feedback instantâneo.
*   **Método 2 (Ponto de Entrada):** Use quando a validação depende de múltiplos campos ou do contexto geral do registro e deve ocorrer antes da gravação final.
*   **Método 3 (Remover Opção):** Use se a opção ""S"" nunca deve ser apresentada ao usuário sob certas condições, melhorando a usabilidade ao evitar que ele selecione algo inválido.

Escolha o método que melhor se adapta ao fluxo do seu processo e ao momento em que a restrição deve ser aplicada. Lembre-se de substituir os comentários `// ADICIONE AQUI A SUA CONDIÇÃO ESPECÍFICA` pela lógica real que determina *quando* a opção ""S"" deve ser restrita.",non-search

00:00:01	vielen Dank Leute ich habe euch richtig vermisst ohne Witz ich war schon länger immer da manchmal merkt man das erst wenn man mal wieder am Ort ist wie lange man nicht mehr da war das wird sich ändern Gott sei Dank ihr werdenet mich mehr sehen ich habe zum Anfang dieser Predigt habe ich eine These Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich klingt extrem unattraktiv wie ich finde dieses Wort Verbindlichkeit macht dich aber attraktiv klingt extrem langweilig macht dein Leben aber

00:00:39	nachhaltig und irgendwo sinnvoll Verbindlichkeit wieso wieso klingt oft auch irgendwo unattraktiv ja es nimmt uns in die Pflicht Verbindlichkeit kann einengen und doch glaube ich wenn wir über Verbindlichkeit reden reden wir nicht von dass wir uns alle Spontanität alle Flexibilität rauben lassen ich glaube es geht darum bei den wesentlichen Dingen verbindlich zu sein und doch ist die Frage erlaubt warum fällt uns denn so schwer es scheint uns nicht ganz leicht zu fallen ich habe mal mich ein bisschen

00:01:21	damit auseinandergesetzt was die Herausforderung ist und ich glaube in der heutigen Zeit in der wir leben ist es herausfordernder als früher ein verbindliches Leben zu führen warum ist das so man sagt dass wir heute auf dem Weg zur Arbeit schon mehr Entscheidungen treffen als unsere Großeltern am ganzen Tag getroffen haben ja triffst du gerne Entscheidung kannst dich gerne auten eine Person zwei Personen dre 4 fünf ja aber die große Mehrheit hat jetzt nicht aufgestreckt es kann anstrengend sein

00:02:01	wir treffen pro Tag rund 20.000 Entscheidungen manche von denen sind unbewusst die allermeisten andere sind sehr bewusst warum ist es so wir haben mehr Option ist ganz einfach früher musste man sich einige Fragen gar nicht stellen vieles war definiert vieles war klar ganz ganz früher war klar wenn du heiratest was du für ein Beruf ausübst wenn du Schaffner heißt bist du Schaffner wenn du Schuhmacher heißt machst du Schuhe verstehst du heute mussen 50 15 oder 14-Jährige Menschen entscheiden was er beruflich machen will

00:02:39	diese Entscheidung müsste früher gar nicht getroffen werden und so hat sich vieles verändert wir können uns auf dem Weg zur Arbeit auch entscheiden wo holen wir einen Kaffee wie schmeckt er was für eine Milch kommt da rein da gibt's ja auch schon acht Optionen mittlerweile an dem durchschnittlichen Kaffeestand und wir lachen jetzt aber es ist anstrengend weil diese viele Optionen die große Challenge ist die die Option stehen dir nicht immer alle gleichzeitig zur Verfügung und das macht so anstrengend also wenn du z.B ein Job

00:03:12	Angebot bekommst und du hast dich vielleicht noch an anderen Orten beworben jetzt sagt dir ein arbeitgebe ja ich würde dich gerne einstellen ja dann musst du dich entscheiden bevor du weißt was die anderen zu dir sagen das ist anstrengend du weißt nicht vielleicht Reiz dich was anderes noch mehr was weißt du ob der dich annehmen würde oder nicht und es kommt so schnell dass wir dieses Gefühl in uns haben eine Angst etwas zu verpassen fear of missing out das ist mittlerweile ein relativ bekannter Begriff geworden wir spüren

00:03:46	das manchmal schon wenn wir eingeladen werden für Freitagabend kommst du weiß noch nicht meine Freundin hat dann noch Geburtstag und vielleicht macht sie dann fest sie hat noch nicht geschrieben aber normalerweise schreibt sie Tage vorher und die halten gerne Dinge offen um die Option parallel abwergen zu können und ich glaube wahnsinnig schlimm ist es nicht ich find es ein bisschen anstrengend problematisch wird's dort wenn es an die Beziehungen geht und ich habe dir eine Statistik mitgebracht eine Statistik zu

00:04:23	Eheschließungen in der Schweiz ich finde das zeigt wunderbar auf was das für eine Challenge für für uns geworden ist ein verbindliches Leben zu führen auch bei unseren Beziehungen 1950 das ist runtergerechnet auf 1000 Einwohner in der Schweiz hatten wir im Jahr 1950 rund neun Eheschließungen auf 1000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner das ganze hat sich ein bisschen entwickelt ein bisschen gespielt man findet arkumente wieso es D und da wieder hochging 2020 waren wir bei rund 4er Eheschließung nicht mal mehr die

00:05:03	Hälfte die Leute sind dennoch in Beziehungen drin das ist nicht der Punkt aber dieses jah bis der Tod uns scheidet wurde irgendwo zu einem ja solange es passt ja solange wir uns lieben ich habe tatsächlich ein Artikel gefunden eine deutsche Politikerin kam auf die geniale Idee die eh auf 7 Jahre zu reduzieren ja man findet auch dafür Argumente 7 Jahre weil alle 7 Jahre verändert sich das Leben spürbar und es kommt in eine andere season rein und vielleicht passt dann nicht mehr und dann ist doch gut

00:05:43	wenn es automatisch ausläuft weil dann hat man die Freiheit sich wieder neu zu kommitten oder jemand anderem zu kommitten man muss nicht unbedingt das Leben lang mit der gleichen Person verbringen ich glaub h hinter allem bin ich fest davon überzeugt dass letzten Endes auch Wied ang Angst steckt ich habe verschiedene Interviews gehört warum will ich nicht heiraten ja das was ich zu Hause gesehen habe das will ich nie ich habe Angst meine Freiheit zu verlieren es kommt viele Aussagen die man irgendwo verstehen kann ich meine in

00:06:20	dem Moment in dem ich meine Frau geheiratet habe sie heißt Meike ja da hatte ich schon auch solche Gedanken ist es wirklich eine gute Entscheidung und ich musste musste sehr sehr gut überleben aber es war die zweitbeste Entscheidung die ich meinem Leben getroffen habe ich komme noch zu besten eigentlich wissen wir es alle Angst ist ein schlechter Ratgeber diese Aussage hören wir immer und immer wieder und doch will ich dir in dem Moment die Frage stellen wie viele Entscheidungen die du triffst sind aus Angst

00:06:59	gesteuert wie viele Entscheidungen triffst du aus einer Angst getrieben wie viele Entscheidungen triffst du vielleicht eben nicht aufgrund deiner Angst es gibt ein Ausdruck der heißt entscheidungsparalyse das ist der Moment wo du merkst es sind so viele Entscheidungen zu treffen und du bist gar nicht mehr fähig die Entscheidung zu treffen bist wie gelähmt das ist entscheidungsparalyse kann passieren manchmal m nur situativ manchmal aber eine längere Zeit aber ist enorm anstrengend Benjamin Franklin da hat man

00:07:36	gesagt die schlimmste Entscheidung ist die Unentschlossenheit keine Entscheidung zu treffen Dinge aufzuschieben weil es anstrengend ist weil man es nicht genau weiß weil man sich nicht ganz sicher ist habe ich alle Optionen vor mir habe ich alle Fakten zu entscheiden schieb ich es lieber mal auf warum ist es so anstrengend jede offene Entscheidung die vor dir liegt wird irgendwann zu Last und mehr das werden desto höher wird diese Berg an Entscheidungen die nicht getroffen sind und die dir Z Last

00:08:09	werden und jetzt ist die Frage was können wir gegen das machen was können wir dagegen machen wenn Ängste uns zu Entscheidungen bewegen wo wir doch genau wissen ist eigentlich ein schlechter Ratgeber oder wenn wir Entscheidungen vor uns herchieben und in so eine entscheidungsparalyse reinrutschen wo wir nicht mehr fähig sind wirklich Entscheidungen zu treffen wir sind im Buch Rut wir schließen heute ab und ich will heute etwas hervorholen aus dem Buch Rut danke ich will etwas hervorholen was vielleicht jetzt gar nicht so geistlich

00:08:48	ist aber ich find es faszinierend wie klar rauskommt wir rollen die Geschichte noch einmal auf vielleicht hast du sie schon sech sben mal gehört aber haben immer Menschen hier zum erst mal ist jemand zum ersten Mal heute hier ja guck mal das ist genial und ich nehme Dich gerne in die Geschichte mit WUM es um Rut geht weil die ersten acht Verse wir lesen Sie kurz durch die fast die Geschichte so gut zusammen da steht zu einer Zeit als das Volk Israel von Männern geführt wurde die man Richter nannte brach im

00:09:18	Land eine Hungersnot aus darum verließ ein Mann namens Elimelech aus der Sippe erat die Stadt Bethlehem in Juda wo er gewohnt hatte mit seiner Frau Nomi und seinen beiden Söhnen machlon kion ins Land Moab und ließ sich dort nieder doch dann starb Elimelech und Nomi blieb mit ihren Söhnen alleine zurück die beiden heirateten zwei Frauen aus Moab sie hießen orpa und Rut nach etwa zwei nach etwa 10 Jahren starben auch machlon und kion nun hatte ni keinen Mann und keine Söhne mehr bald darauf erfuhr sie dass der Herr sich

00:09:59	über sein Volk erbarmt und es wieder eine gute Ernte geschenkt hatte sofort brach sie auf um in ihre Heimat Juda zurückzukehren ihre schwiegetöchter begleiteten sie unterwegs sagte Nomi zu Ihnen geht doch wieder zurück in euer Elternhaus geht zurück nach Moab kehrt um möge der Herr euch so viel Liebe erweisen wie ihr sie den Verstorbenen und mir entgegengebracht habt das ist die Story wir haben eine Hungersnot in Israel eine israelische Familie entscheidet sich nach Moab zu gehen klingt mal relativ logisch ist

00:10:36	aber auch relativ problematisch weil Gott hat ausdrücklich gesagt haltet euch von Moab fern geht nicht dorthin das hat eine Geschichte die kannst du in den Büchern Mose lesen damals als Israel flüchten musste haben sich die Moabit verschlossen gesagt unser Land dürft die nicht durchqueren und Gott hat Konsequenzen gezogen Moab betet den anderen Gott an ein Gott dem man Kinder opfert sie machen scheußliche Dinge haltet euch fern von diesem Volk je Berührung ist eine zuviel geht nicht dahin verbündet euch nicht mit ihnen und

00:11:07	alles was wir da lesen ist das Gegenteil von dem von was Gott sagt aber wir haben Verständnis dafür wenn deine Familie hungert ja da musst du irgendwie gucken dass was zu Essen auf dem Tisch kommt und irgendwann drei Todesfälle später ist die Hungersnot vorbei und die Frauen gehen zurück und sie entscheiden sich zuck zurück zu gehen aber auf dem Weg denkt sich Nomi das kann ich den beiden nicht antun sie weiß wahrscheinlich sind die beiden jungen Schwiegertöchter die sie hat die einzige Hoffnung für eine irgendwo valable

00:11:48	Zukunft für sie und gleichzeitig weiß sie die werden dort Ausländer sein also noch weniger als Asylanten die werden keine Anerkennung haben die Moabit sind es verfeindete Volk vom Volk Israel die werden dort keinen Status haben die werden keinen Mann finden ich kann denen das nicht antun und sie diskutiert mit ihnen und die eine die ORP die lenkt ein und geht zurück in ihr Elternhaus aber Rut nicht und wir lesen Ruts Antwort bestehe nicht darauf dass ich dich verlasse ich will mich nicht von dir

00:12:26	trennen wo du hingehst da will auch ich hingehen wo du bleibst da bleibe auch ich dein Volk ist mein Volk und dein Gott ist mein Gott wo du stirbst werde auch ich sterben und begraben werden nur der Tod kann mich von dir trennen wenn ich dieses Versprechen nicht halte soll der Herr mich hart bestrafen Nomi merkte dass Rut darauf bestand mit dir zu gehen und so versuchte sie nicht mehr sie zur Umkehr zu überreden n hat alles probiert sie zu überzeugen weil sie ganz genau wusste sie sie kann ja gar keine Perspektive auf ein gutes

00:13:08	Leben schenken und or hat eingewilligt hat eingesehen gesagt ja wahrscheinlich macht Sinn wahrscheinlich macht Sinn aber Rut blieb standhaft und hat so lange entgegenehalten bis ni aufgegeben hat warum warum hat macht ich habe mir das echt ein bisschen überlegt m und ich ich finde ein paar Punkte ich finde den Punkt sie kannte Moab sie wusste genau was dort passiert wenn du in dem Land lebst in dem deinem Gott Kinder geopfert werden ich weiß nicht wie gerne man dort lebt ich weiß nicht wie das war als Frau

00:13:51	ich kann mir vorstellen dass es dort auch anstrengend war und und dann hat sie eine andere Familie kennengelernt eine israelische Familie hat eingeheiratet hat mindestens 10 Jahre mit ihn verbracht hat den lebendigen Gott kennengelernt und ich kann mir irgendwo vorstellen dass sie selbst eine Beziehung zu diesem Gott eingegangen ist dass sie selbst irgendwo verstanden hat was diese Geschichte mit dem Volk Israel und ihrem Gott bedeutet und wie treu er immer war und dass das zum Leben führt aber

00:14:27	gleichzeitig frage ich mich Moment die hat selbst miterlebt wie der Versorger elimelich gestorben ist der Vater der Familie sie selbst hat ihren Mann verloren und der Bruder ist auch gestorben also frage ich mich wie hat in dem Augenblick die Beziehung zu Gott ausgesehen wie war die wirklich wir können da vieles reininpretieren aber etwas was ganz ganz klar aus der Aussage hervorkommt ist der einfache Fakt dass Rut nicht von weg wollte da war eine Beziehung die waren mehr als einfach nur Schwiegermutter

00:15:05	Tochter da war eine echte innige Beziehung eine Freundschaft da und sie wollte nicht von ihrer Seite weg Rut wusste genauso wenn ich jetzt zurückgehe dann ist Nomi geliefert die wusste das genau und die sagte auf keinen Fall gehe ich weg nur der Tod kann mich von dir wegholen und Rut hätte Taus Gründe gehabt ihren Ängsten zu folgen ich glaube nicht dass wir uns das überhaupt noch vorstellen können wie das Leben für Rut aussehen musste als sie nach Israel kam diese Offenheit für Ausländer die wir heute haben die war damals nicht

00:15:45	da die Stellung der Frau wie wir sie heute in der Gesellschaft haben noch nicht so wie wir sie wollen aber die war damals ganz ganz anders eine Frau hatte keine Stimme in der Gesellschaft die konnte sich nicht selbst besorgen die hatte keine Bilder die konnte sich nicht einfach ein Job suchen und sagen ich versorge mich jetzt halt selbst die war ausgeliefert und sie wusste genau die Wahrscheinlichkeit dass ich ein Mann finde in Israel die ist gleich null Taus Gründe hätte sie gehabt ihren Ängsten zu folgen und den Weg zurück

00:16:17	nach Moab zu gehen aber sie tat es nicht für sie war klar ich habe mich für diese Familie entschieden und damals das ist das ein wichtigge Punkt den wir verstehen müssen damals wenn du als Frau geheiratet hast war klar ich habe eine neue Familie da hast du deine alte Familie zurückgelassen hast dich deine neuen Familie angeschlossen das war nicht wie heute und wenn dein Mann gestorben ist dann hat sich der Bruder des Mannes um dich gekümmert also wenn dein Mann damals gestorben ist bist du nicht wieder

00:16:52	zurück in deine alte Familie sondern du bist in deiner neuen Familie geblieben diese Familie die du geheirat das war dein neues Zuhause deine neue Familie und sie wusste mein ja ist ein ja ich habe ja gesagt nicht nur zu meinem Mann sondern auch zu seiner ganzen Familie und jetzt ist mein Mann halt tot ja ich habe immer noch ja gesagt ich glaube wenn Ängste da sind die uns steuern wenn wir merken dass Ängste unsere Entscheidungen leiten dann gibt's nur etwas was hilft diesen Ängsten zu begegnen das ist

00:17:35	Sicherheit wir brauchen Sicherheit wenn wir uns wieder sicher fühlen können wir wieder konstruktive Entscheidung treffen die nicht von Angst gesteuert sind man sieht ganz klar in diese Geschichte wie überzeugt Rut war und diese Überzeugung die gab ihr eine Sicherheit sie war fest davon überzeugt das was ich hier tu wenn ich bei Nomi bleib das ist das richtige für mich sie war der Überzeugung ich habe ja gesagt und ich bleib bei diesem Jahr komme was wolle und ich habe damit wir ein bisschen zurückkommen in unser Leben

00:18:14	habe ich mir die Frage gestellt wovon bin ich denn überzeugt weil in dieser ganze Situation dass ich auch jeden Tag 20 000 Entscheidungen treffen muss darf und viel viel mehr Option habe als mein Großvater damals muss ich auch irgendwelche Überzeugungen in mir haben umso wichtiger finde ich ist es Überzeugung zu haben ich habe mir Gedanken gemacht wie sehen meine Überzeugungen aus und ich hatte jetzt nicht monatelang Zeit dafür ich habe das einfach im Zuge meiner Predigtvorbereitung gemacht habe mir mal

00:18:50	die Frage gestellt wovon bin ich überzeugt wozu habe ich ein jah um es mal anders zu formulieren und ich habe das für mich mal so abgegrenzt ich hab ein jah zu Jesus ich habe ein jah zu einem Leben mit Jesus das stelle ich nicht ständig in Frage ich habe mich mal entschieden ich habe mich mal taufen lassen das war die beste Entscheidung meines lebensall ja das war die beste Entscheidung meines Lebens das gibt mir halt das gibt mir Sicherheit das führt mich zum wahren Leben und wenn meine Gefühle mich

00:19:37	weggleiten von ihm weiß ich ich habe ja gesagt ich habe mich taufen lassen Menschen haben zugeguckt und können mich heute dran erinnern ich war dabei du hast ja gesagt und diese Überzeugung ist fest in meinem Herzen weil ich erlebe auch Tage und Wochen wo ich merke oh das kostet wirklich einen hohen Preis und ich verstehe mehr und mehr was er meint wenn es sagt du musst dein Leben verlieren wenn du es geähen willst und meinet ween das kostet seinen Preis aber ich habe ja gesagt und diese Überzeugung

00:20:10	gibt mir eine Sicherheit da muss ich nicht immer wieder drüber nachdenken Woche für Woche ja sage ich diese Woche wieder ja zu Jesus nein ich habe ja gesagt auf ein ganzes Leben kann man gut lesen gell mit diesen Stiften brauch sie zum ersten Mal hinten auch wunderbar ich habe ein jah zu Meike meike ist meine Frau ich habe vor dem Altar habe ich sie von Ralph in die Hände gegeben bekommen in der Hoffnung und dem Vertrauen dass ich mich gut um sie kümmer ja ich weiß es noch ja und ich bin so dankbar und ich bin

00:21:04	überzeugt von dieser Beziehung es ist eine Überzeugung tief in mir drin ich habe ein jah zu ihr für mein ganzes Leben laufen mir andere schöne Frauen über den Weg natürlich streiten wir uns geht sie mir ab und zu auf die Nerven und ich denke was habe ich hier getan ja natürlich logisch wir sind auch ein Ehepaar wie jedes andere ist es anstrengend manchmal dieses Jahr zu halten natürlich der Preis ist hoch aber ich bin überzeugt das macht absolut Sinn und das lohnt sich und es hilft mir habe ich eine

00:21:45	Überzeugung für sie weil auch wenn die Gefühle mal weggehen auch wenn plötzlich eine andere Frau kommt ich habe ein Ja zu ihr ich muss das nicht immer wieder in Frage stellen das ist eine tiefe Überzeugung im mir drin ich habe ein jah zu meinen Kids ich habe jetzt drei davon drei Geschenke Gottes wunderbar aber drei die mich auch zum Wahnsinn bringen können wirklich die können mich fertig machen und manchmal Gefühl die haben irgendwie den Auftrag gefasst von jemanden aber ich habe ein Ja zu ihnen

00:22:34	das ist völlig unabhängig davon wie sie ihr Leben leben wie sie mit mir umgehen ob sie die Beziehung so mit mir gestalten auch in Zukunft wie ich es mir wünsche ich habe ein Jahr zu Ihnen und das hängt nicht davon ab was Sie tun oder was ich fühle dieses Jahr gilt Punkt ausende diese Frage stelle ich mir nie ich habe ein Jahr zu im Leben mit meinen Kids ich kann sie auch ab und zu mal ausleihen das geht auch wenn ihr mal ein Tag sind toll die können mal einen Tag mit ihnen verbringen ich bin das sehr

00:23:19	easy und ich habe ein Jahr zur Kirche warum weil die Kirche ist der H die Hoffnung der Welt der Satz kommt nicht von mir könnte aber die Kirche ist die Hoffnung diese Welt wir haben das völlig aus den Augen verloren als Gesellschaft wir können uns den Mund zerreißen über all über all dem schlechten was in der Kirche passiert und die Zeitung Liebens diese drecksgeschichten hochzuspüen und dabei vergessen wir dass jedes Spital die Schulen all dies sozial diakonischen Einrichtung alles aus der Kirche

00:24:01	rausgewachsen ist heute ist viel selbstverständlich von dem und die fragen uns wofür brauchen die Kirche noch ja guck mal die Einsamkeit an in unserer Gesellschaft guck mal die Hoffnungslosigkeit an wir brauchen die Kirche mehr mehr als jemals zuvor und ich bin überzeugt davon es lohnt sich ja zu sagen zur Kirche und dieses jah weißt du das hat ein Preis das hat eine Auswirkung mit mir kannst Du kein Familienfest machen am Sonntag nee weil ich gehe in die Kirche ich will dort Beziehungen haben ich will

00:24:32	die Menschen nicht nur alle dritte Woche sehen das kostet mich viel heute habe ich eine präigt und ich bin mit meinen zwei kleinen Mädchen hier und ich hoffe dass sie im Baby world durchhalten und es war anstrengend weil beide haben geschrienen zu Hause als ich sie ins Fahrrad gesetzt habe und es kostet aber ich bin überzeugt das macht absolut Sinn es lohnt sich mein Jahr zu geben für meine Kirche und das kann Preis Kosten und ich bin bereit ihn zu bezahlen ihr könnt alle aufhören mit Kirche bauen ich mache

00:25:06	weiter hört nicht auf aber wenn ihr es tut mache ich trotzdem weiter versteht ihr weil mein ja ist nicht abhängig davon ob du weiter machst sondern ich habe eine Überzeugung dass es gut ist und das bewegt mich dazu immer wieder eine Entscheidung zu treffen jeden Sonntag in die Kirche zu gehen um meinen Preis dafür zu bezahlen zu anderen Dingen nein sagen du musst verstehen dass wenn wenn ich hier ja schreibe hinter all den J es kommen ganz ganz viele nein Überzeugungen Kosten Überzeugungen Kosten Rut hat ein

00:25:40	riesigen Preis bezahlt für ihr J zur Nomi aber ich habe dir gesagt Verbindlichkeit Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich und zwei Punkte wieso das eine ist Verbindlichkeit macht dich attraktiv in eine Zeit in der wir Spontanität und Flexibilität ganz ganz groß schreiben ständige Verfügbarkeit enorm groß sind glaube ich klare Überzeugungen entschiedenes Handeln danach machen dich attraktiv guck dir mal richtig entschlossene Menschen an mit denen willst du zusammen sein mit denen willst du unterwegs sein

00:26:36	das sind die Menschen die dich inspirieren die wissen wofür sie hier sind wofür sie gehen wofür sie nicht gehen und auch entsprechend danach handeln und das hat auch Rut erlebt die war zurück in Israel hatte nichts zu essen Nomi war depressiv daheim in der Stube und sie ging aufs Feld und das durfte man damals am Rand die liegenelassenen eren lesen damit sie Brot backen kann und dann kam Boas und Boas lät sie ein und lässt sie sogar mit den mäkten ernten also nicht einfach nur das liegen geblieben ist son

00:27:14	sie dfte sie durfte ganz einfach die Körper füllen und hat gesagt gesagt wenn du Durst hast trink vom Wasser was sie geschöpft haben er war extrem großzügig zu ihr und sie erschragförmlich da warf Rut sich vor ihm nieder und fragte womit habe ich das verdient warum beachtest du mich obwohl ich eine Ausländerin bin und was sagt Boas man hat mir berichtet wie du seit dem Tod eines Mannes deine Schwiegermutter beigestanden hast deine Eltern und dein Land verlassen hast und dich und dein Volk angeschlossen hast dass du vorher

00:27:46	nicht kanntest als ich habe gesehen mir wurde berichtet was du für ein Preis bezahlt hast wie treu und loyal du bist und das hat mich beeindruckt weiß du Boas hat Letten long story short Rut Z Frau genommen der fand sie attraktiv der musste sie nicht heiraten er konnte damals gab's jüische Regeln ihm das ermöglicht haben weil sie aus derselben Sippe kam aber er hätte sie nicht heiraten müssen hätte einin sagen können aber da war etwas anziehendes der hat gesehen dass sie bereit ist ein Preis für ihre Überzeugung zu bezahlen das hat

00:28:20	sie attraktiv gemacht der zweite Punkt wieo ich überzeug bin D uns Verbindlichkeit glücklich macht ist eine konstante Verbindlichkeit hinterlässt etwas Bleibendes we es gibt so viele Menschen die nur noch die Fahne im Wind machen kommt der Wind von hier gehen wir hier lang kommt er von da gehen wir da lang und ich frage dich was hinterlassen wir wenn wir so unser Leben leben wenn wir so Beziehung leben wenn ich so unser Leben gestalten was bleibt wenn wir mal nicht mehr sind wenn du deine Überzeugungen hast

00:29:04	wenn du entschlossen danach handelst dann wird etwas bleiben wenn du nicht mehr bist und ich glaube diesen Wunsch haben wir alle in uns etwas zu hinterlassen etwas Sinnvolles zu tun etwas zu tun was wirklich wert hat der über unsere Lebzeit hinausgeht Rut und Boas die haben ein Kind bekommen das Kind ist obet obet gaben sie Nomi ihr erstes Kind gaben sie Nomi damit dieses Kind wenn es mal groß ist Nomi wieder versorgen würde weil sie wussten sie sie wird jemanden brauchen der sie ernährt der sich um sie

00:29:46	kümmert im Alter Obert hat dann auch wieder geheiratet auch wieder Kinder bekommen aus ob kam irgendwann der große König David hervor und irgendwann kam der Jesus aus dieser Linie hervor was wä passiert wenn Rut nicht ihren Überzeugung gefolgt wä ich weiß Gott kann Geschichten auch anders schreiben aber hat sie so geschrieben Brut hat einen riesigen Preis bezahlt aber ein Leben lang hat ihre Bezeugung und hat danach gehandelt und sie hinterlässt etwas etwas Großes aus dieser treue aus dieser Loyalität kam ein große Könige vor der

00:30:43	das Leben zurück nach Israel brachte aus dieser Linie kam Jesus Christus [Musik] hervor und ich will dir das zurufen mit Jesus Christus kam auch das von Gott zu dir auf diese Welt ich will dir Mut machen wenn du Mühe hast Entscheidung zu treffen den du spürst das Ängste dich immer wieder einholen dich immer wieder fest im Griff haben sei dir bewusst dass Gott ein Ja zu dir hat wei du da reden wir nicht einfach mehr von irgendwie Selbstvertrauen oder so das ist ein Fundament auf das du dich stellen kannst wenn du weißt Gott ist

00:31:28	für mich Gott hat sich selbst hingegeben für mich weil er mit mir gemeinsam das Leben gestalten will das ist ein ja auf das kannst du bauen und das gibt dir wiederum die Sicherheit um deine Überzeugung zu definieren und aus Überzeugung raus zu handeln du musst nicht immer alles richtig machen das Buch Rut ist so wunderbar weil es uns zeigt du kannst alles verkacken und trotzdem schreibt Gott seine Geschichte mit dir elimele ich hat alles falsch gemacht er hat sich klar gegen die Weisung Gottes gestellt sich

00:32:00	nach Moab zu begeben und das hatte Konsequenzen er ist gestorben seine Söhne sind gestorben seine Söhne haben alles falsch gemacht als sie zwei morabiterin geheiratet haben ja und jetzt spätestens in dem Zeitpunkt kann ein der Gedanke kommen ja dann sucht Gott wahrscheinlich jemand anderen weit gefehlt er schreibt seine Geschichte weiter mit einer moabiterin mit der er mit seinem Volk eigentlich nicht nie was zu tun haben wollte und das ihr kommt König David hervor und Jesus Christus und sie wird Teil zum des standbaumes von Jesus

00:32:44	Christus das kannst du im Matthäusevangelium lesen die moabiterin Rut das Resultat aus ganz vielen angstgetriebenen und falschen Entscheidungen wozu Gott gesagt hat Treff sie nicht mach es nicht und gleichzeitig sehen wir Gottes jaah zu ihr Gottes jaah zu diese Familie die viele Fehler gemacht hat und Gott schreibt seine neue konstruktive Geschichte mit ihnen und ich will dir das zum Ende dieser Serie zurufen gott hat ein Ja zu dir lass dieses Jahr das lauteste sein in deinem Herzen schau dass du dieses Jahr nie vergisst

00:33:30	weil dieses Jahr befähigt dich wieder um selbst ja zu Dingen zu sagen zu Überzeugung zu finden und entschlossen danach zu handeln und du wirst sehen dieses Jahr wirerd dich zu einem verbindlichen Leben bewegen wo du ja zu den wesentlichen Dingen sagst und deswegen bin ich überzeugt dass Verbindlichkeit dich glücklich macht lass uns noch ein Moment Zeit nehmen jetzt wo wir einfach Gott Raum geben dass jetzt zu uns sprechen kann okay ich Bee mit uns ich danke dir für deine Treue für deine Loyalität ich danke dir dass du

00:34:20	uns mit solchen Geschichten wie die Geschichte mit Rut und Nomi dass du uns etwas zeigst nämlich dass du treu bist auch wenn wir es nicht sind dass du dich an dein Wort hältst auch wenn wir es nicht tun dass du dich an deine Regeln hälst auch wenn wir sie nicht befolgen danke dass deine Gnade so unglaublich groß ist dass wir nichts tun können was uns von dir wegbringt dass wir nichts tun können was du zuu führen würde dass diese Beziehung zu dir bricht [Musik] danke für dieses Jahr zu uns unabhängig davon wie wir unser Leben

","Okay, hier ist eine Zusammenfassung des Vortrags:

Der Redner beginnt mit der These: **""Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich""**. Obwohl das Wort unattraktiv klingen mag, argumentiert er, dass Verbindlichkeit das Leben sinnvoll, nachhaltig und die Person selbst attraktiv macht.

Er stellt fest, dass Verbindlichkeit heute schwerfällt, weil wir mit einer enormen Anzahl von Entscheidungen und Optionen konfrontiert sind (viel mehr als frühere Generationen), was zu Entscheidungsstress und der ""Fear of Missing Out"" (FOMO) führt. Dies zeigt sich z.B. in sinkenden Eheschließungszahlen und der Tendenz, Beziehungen als weniger dauerhaft anzusehen.

Die Ursache für diese Unverbindlichkeit sieht der Redner oft in **Angst**: Angst, etwas Falsches zu wählen, Freiheit zu verlieren oder schlechte Erfahrungen zu wiederholen. Angst sei jedoch ein schlechter Ratgeber und könne zu ""Entscheidungsparalyse"" führen.

Als zentrales Beispiel dient die **Geschichte von Rut** aus der Bibel. Obwohl sie allen Grund zur Angst gehabt hätte (als verwitwete Ausländerin ohne Perspektive nach Israel zurückzukehren), entschied sich Rut aus tiefer Überzeugung und Loyalität, bei ihrer Schwiegermutter Noomi zu bleiben (""Wo du hingehst, da will auch ich hingehen...""). Ihre Sicherheit kam nicht aus den Umständen, sondern aus ihrer festen Überzeugung und ihrem ""Ja"" zu Noomi und deren Familie.

Der Redner überträgt dies auf das persönliche Leben und betont die Wichtigkeit, eigene **feste Überzeugungen** zu haben und ein klares ""Ja"" zu wesentlichen Dingen zu sagen. Er nennt seine persönlichen ""Jas"": zu Jesus, zu seiner Frau Meike, zu seinen Kindern und zur Kirche. Diese Überzeugungen geben Sicherheit und Richtung, auch wenn es kostet und man zu anderen Dingen ""Nein"" sagen muss.

Er nennt zwei Hauptgründe, warum Verbindlichkeit glücklich macht:
1.  **Verbindlichkeit macht attraktiv**: Entschlossene Menschen mit klaren Überzeugungen wirken anziehend (wie Rut auf Boas wirkte).
2.  **Verbindlichkeit hinterlässt etwas Bleibendes**: Ein Leben, das auf Überzeugungen basiert und danach handelt, schafft einen sinnvollen, dauerhaften Einfluss, der über die eigene Lebenszeit hinausgeht (wie Ruts Treue zur Linie von König David und Jesus führte).

Abschließend betont der Redner, dass die größte Sicherheit aus **Gottes ""Ja"" zu uns** durch Jesus Christus kommt. Dieses göttliche ""Ja"" ist das Fundament, das uns befähigt, Ängste zu überwinden, eigene Überzeugungen zu finden und ein verbindliches Leben zu führen – selbst wenn wir Fehler machen, wie es auch in Ruts Familiengeschichte der Fall war. Gottes Treue ermöglicht es uns, verbindlich zu leben und dadurch glücklicher zu werden.",search

00:00:01	vielen Dank Leute ich habe euch richtig vermisst ohne Witz ich war schon länger immer da manchmal merkt man das erst wenn man mal wieder am Ort ist wie lange man nicht mehr da war das wird sich ändern Gott sei Dank ihr werdenet mich mehr sehen ich habe zum Anfang dieser Predigt habe ich eine These Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich klingt extrem unattraktiv wie ich finde dieses Wort Verbindlichkeit macht dich aber attraktiv klingt extrem langweilig macht dein Leben aber

00:00:39	nachhaltig und irgendwo sinnvoll Verbindlichkeit wieso wieso klingt oft auch irgendwo unattraktiv ja es nimmt uns in die Pflicht Verbindlichkeit kann einengen und doch glaube ich wenn wir über Verbindlichkeit reden reden wir nicht von dass wir uns alle Spontanität alle Flexibilität rauben lassen ich glaube es geht darum bei den wesentlichen Dingen verbindlich zu sein und doch ist die Frage erlaubt warum fällt uns denn so schwer es scheint uns nicht ganz leicht zu fallen ich habe mal mich ein bisschen

00:01:21	damit auseinandergesetzt was die Herausforderung ist und ich glaube in der heutigen Zeit in der wir leben ist es herausfordernder als früher ein verbindliches Leben zu führen warum ist das so man sagt dass wir heute auf dem Weg zur Arbeit schon mehr Entscheidungen treffen als unsere Großeltern am ganzen Tag getroffen haben ja triffst du gerne Entscheidung kannst dich gerne auten eine Person zwei Personen dre 4 fünf ja aber die große Mehrheit hat jetzt nicht aufgestreckt es kann anstrengend sein

00:02:01	wir treffen pro Tag rund 20.000 Entscheidungen manche von denen sind unbewusst die allermeisten andere sind sehr bewusst warum ist es so wir haben mehr Option ist ganz einfach früher musste man sich einige Fragen gar nicht stellen vieles war definiert vieles war klar ganz ganz früher war klar wenn du heiratest was du für ein Beruf ausübst wenn du Schaffner heißt bist du Schaffner wenn du Schuhmacher heißt machst du Schuhe verstehst du heute mussen 50 15 oder 14-Jährige Menschen entscheiden was er beruflich machen will

00:02:39	diese Entscheidung müsste früher gar nicht getroffen werden und so hat sich vieles verändert wir können uns auf dem Weg zur Arbeit auch entscheiden wo holen wir einen Kaffee wie schmeckt er was für eine Milch kommt da rein da gibt's ja auch schon acht Optionen mittlerweile an dem durchschnittlichen Kaffeestand und wir lachen jetzt aber es ist anstrengend weil diese viele Optionen die große Challenge ist die die Option stehen dir nicht immer alle gleichzeitig zur Verfügung und das macht so anstrengend also wenn du z.B ein Job

00:03:12	Angebot bekommst und du hast dich vielleicht noch an anderen Orten beworben jetzt sagt dir ein arbeitgebe ja ich würde dich gerne einstellen ja dann musst du dich entscheiden bevor du weißt was die anderen zu dir sagen das ist anstrengend du weißt nicht vielleicht Reiz dich was anderes noch mehr was weißt du ob der dich annehmen würde oder nicht und es kommt so schnell dass wir dieses Gefühl in uns haben eine Angst etwas zu verpassen fear of missing out das ist mittlerweile ein relativ bekannter Begriff geworden wir spüren

00:03:46	das manchmal schon wenn wir eingeladen werden für Freitagabend kommst du weiß noch nicht meine Freundin hat dann noch Geburtstag und vielleicht macht sie dann fest sie hat noch nicht geschrieben aber normalerweise schreibt sie Tage vorher und die halten gerne Dinge offen um die Option parallel abwergen zu können und ich glaube wahnsinnig schlimm ist es nicht ich find es ein bisschen anstrengend problematisch wird's dort wenn es an die Beziehungen geht und ich habe dir eine Statistik mitgebracht eine Statistik zu

00:04:23	Eheschließungen in der Schweiz ich finde das zeigt wunderbar auf was das für eine Challenge für für uns geworden ist ein verbindliches Leben zu führen auch bei unseren Beziehungen 1950 das ist runtergerechnet auf 1000 Einwohner in der Schweiz hatten wir im Jahr 1950 rund neun Eheschließungen auf 1000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner das ganze hat sich ein bisschen entwickelt ein bisschen gespielt man findet arkumente wieso es D und da wieder hochging 2020 waren wir bei rund 4er Eheschließung nicht mal mehr die

00:05:03	Hälfte die Leute sind dennoch in Beziehungen drin das ist nicht der Punkt aber dieses jah bis der Tod uns scheidet wurde irgendwo zu einem ja solange es passt ja solange wir uns lieben ich habe tatsächlich ein Artikel gefunden eine deutsche Politikerin kam auf die geniale Idee die eh auf 7 Jahre zu reduzieren ja man findet auch dafür Argumente 7 Jahre weil alle 7 Jahre verändert sich das Leben spürbar und es kommt in eine andere season rein und vielleicht passt dann nicht mehr und dann ist doch gut

00:05:43	wenn es automatisch ausläuft weil dann hat man die Freiheit sich wieder neu zu kommitten oder jemand anderem zu kommitten man muss nicht unbedingt das Leben lang mit der gleichen Person verbringen ich glaub h hinter allem bin ich fest davon überzeugt dass letzten Endes auch Wied ang Angst steckt ich habe verschiedene Interviews gehört warum will ich nicht heiraten ja das was ich zu Hause gesehen habe das will ich nie ich habe Angst meine Freiheit zu verlieren es kommt viele Aussagen die man irgendwo verstehen kann ich meine in

00:06:20	dem Moment in dem ich meine Frau geheiratet habe sie heißt Meike ja da hatte ich schon auch solche Gedanken ist es wirklich eine gute Entscheidung und ich musste musste sehr sehr gut überleben aber es war die zweitbeste Entscheidung die ich meinem Leben getroffen habe ich komme noch zu besten eigentlich wissen wir es alle Angst ist ein schlechter Ratgeber diese Aussage hören wir immer und immer wieder und doch will ich dir in dem Moment die Frage stellen wie viele Entscheidungen die du triffst sind aus Angst

00:06:59	gesteuert wie viele Entscheidungen triffst du aus einer Angst getrieben wie viele Entscheidungen triffst du vielleicht eben nicht aufgrund deiner Angst es gibt ein Ausdruck der heißt entscheidungsparalyse das ist der Moment wo du merkst es sind so viele Entscheidungen zu treffen und du bist gar nicht mehr fähig die Entscheidung zu treffen bist wie gelähmt das ist entscheidungsparalyse kann passieren manchmal m nur situativ manchmal aber eine längere Zeit aber ist enorm anstrengend Benjamin Franklin da hat man

00:07:36	gesagt die schlimmste Entscheidung ist die Unentschlossenheit keine Entscheidung zu treffen Dinge aufzuschieben weil es anstrengend ist weil man es nicht genau weiß weil man sich nicht ganz sicher ist habe ich alle Optionen vor mir habe ich alle Fakten zu entscheiden schieb ich es lieber mal auf warum ist es so anstrengend jede offene Entscheidung die vor dir liegt wird irgendwann zu Last und mehr das werden desto höher wird diese Berg an Entscheidungen die nicht getroffen sind und die dir Z Last

00:08:09	werden und jetzt ist die Frage was können wir gegen das machen was können wir dagegen machen wenn Ängste uns zu Entscheidungen bewegen wo wir doch genau wissen ist eigentlich ein schlechter Ratgeber oder wenn wir Entscheidungen vor uns herchieben und in so eine entscheidungsparalyse reinrutschen wo wir nicht mehr fähig sind wirklich Entscheidungen zu treffen wir sind im Buch Rut wir schließen heute ab und ich will heute etwas hervorholen aus dem Buch Rut danke ich will etwas hervorholen was vielleicht jetzt gar nicht so geistlich

00:08:48	ist aber ich find es faszinierend wie klar rauskommt wir rollen die Geschichte noch einmal auf vielleicht hast du sie schon sech sben mal gehört aber haben immer Menschen hier zum erst mal ist jemand zum ersten Mal heute hier ja guck mal das ist genial und ich nehme Dich gerne in die Geschichte mit WUM es um Rut geht weil die ersten acht Verse wir lesen Sie kurz durch die fast die Geschichte so gut zusammen da steht zu einer Zeit als das Volk Israel von Männern geführt wurde die man Richter nannte brach im

00:09:18	Land eine Hungersnot aus darum verließ ein Mann namens Elimelech aus der Sippe erat die Stadt Bethlehem in Juda wo er gewohnt hatte mit seiner Frau Nomi und seinen beiden Söhnen machlon kion ins Land Moab und ließ sich dort nieder doch dann starb Elimelech und Nomi blieb mit ihren Söhnen alleine zurück die beiden heirateten zwei Frauen aus Moab sie hießen orpa und Rut nach etwa zwei nach etwa 10 Jahren starben auch machlon und kion nun hatte ni keinen Mann und keine Söhne mehr bald darauf erfuhr sie dass der Herr sich

00:09:59	über sein Volk erbarmt und es wieder eine gute Ernte geschenkt hatte sofort brach sie auf um in ihre Heimat Juda zurückzukehren ihre schwiegetöchter begleiteten sie unterwegs sagte Nomi zu Ihnen geht doch wieder zurück in euer Elternhaus geht zurück nach Moab kehrt um möge der Herr euch so viel Liebe erweisen wie ihr sie den Verstorbenen und mir entgegengebracht habt das ist die Story wir haben eine Hungersnot in Israel eine israelische Familie entscheidet sich nach Moab zu gehen klingt mal relativ logisch ist

00:10:36	aber auch relativ problematisch weil Gott hat ausdrücklich gesagt haltet euch von Moab fern geht nicht dorthin das hat eine Geschichte die kannst du in den Büchern Mose lesen damals als Israel flüchten musste haben sich die Moabit verschlossen gesagt unser Land dürft die nicht durchqueren und Gott hat Konsequenzen gezogen Moab betet den anderen Gott an ein Gott dem man Kinder opfert sie machen scheußliche Dinge haltet euch fern von diesem Volk je Berührung ist eine zuviel geht nicht dahin verbündet euch nicht mit ihnen und

00:11:07	alles was wir da lesen ist das Gegenteil von dem von was Gott sagt aber wir haben Verständnis dafür wenn deine Familie hungert ja da musst du irgendwie gucken dass was zu Essen auf dem Tisch kommt und irgendwann drei Todesfälle später ist die Hungersnot vorbei und die Frauen gehen zurück und sie entscheiden sich zuck zurück zu gehen aber auf dem Weg denkt sich Nomi das kann ich den beiden nicht antun sie weiß wahrscheinlich sind die beiden jungen Schwiegertöchter die sie hat die einzige Hoffnung für eine irgendwo valable

00:11:48	Zukunft für sie und gleichzeitig weiß sie die werden dort Ausländer sein also noch weniger als Asylanten die werden keine Anerkennung haben die Moabit sind es verfeindete Volk vom Volk Israel die werden dort keinen Status haben die werden keinen Mann finden ich kann denen das nicht antun und sie diskutiert mit ihnen und die eine die ORP die lenkt ein und geht zurück in ihr Elternhaus aber Rut nicht und wir lesen Ruts Antwort bestehe nicht darauf dass ich dich verlasse ich will mich nicht von dir

00:12:26	trennen wo du hingehst da will auch ich hingehen wo du bleibst da bleibe auch ich dein Volk ist mein Volk und dein Gott ist mein Gott wo du stirbst werde auch ich sterben und begraben werden nur der Tod kann mich von dir trennen wenn ich dieses Versprechen nicht halte soll der Herr mich hart bestrafen Nomi merkte dass Rut darauf bestand mit dir zu gehen und so versuchte sie nicht mehr sie zur Umkehr zu überreden n hat alles probiert sie zu überzeugen weil sie ganz genau wusste sie sie kann ja gar keine Perspektive auf ein gutes

00:13:08	Leben schenken und or hat eingewilligt hat eingesehen gesagt ja wahrscheinlich macht Sinn wahrscheinlich macht Sinn aber Rut blieb standhaft und hat so lange entgegenehalten bis ni aufgegeben hat warum warum hat macht ich habe mir das echt ein bisschen überlegt m und ich ich finde ein paar Punkte ich finde den Punkt sie kannte Moab sie wusste genau was dort passiert wenn du in dem Land lebst in dem deinem Gott Kinder geopfert werden ich weiß nicht wie gerne man dort lebt ich weiß nicht wie das war als Frau

00:13:51	ich kann mir vorstellen dass es dort auch anstrengend war und und dann hat sie eine andere Familie kennengelernt eine israelische Familie hat eingeheiratet hat mindestens 10 Jahre mit ihn verbracht hat den lebendigen Gott kennengelernt und ich kann mir irgendwo vorstellen dass sie selbst eine Beziehung zu diesem Gott eingegangen ist dass sie selbst irgendwo verstanden hat was diese Geschichte mit dem Volk Israel und ihrem Gott bedeutet und wie treu er immer war und dass das zum Leben führt aber

00:14:27	gleichzeitig frage ich mich Moment die hat selbst miterlebt wie der Versorger elimelich gestorben ist der Vater der Familie sie selbst hat ihren Mann verloren und der Bruder ist auch gestorben also frage ich mich wie hat in dem Augenblick die Beziehung zu Gott ausgesehen wie war die wirklich wir können da vieles reininpretieren aber etwas was ganz ganz klar aus der Aussage hervorkommt ist der einfache Fakt dass Rut nicht von weg wollte da war eine Beziehung die waren mehr als einfach nur Schwiegermutter

00:15:05	Tochter da war eine echte innige Beziehung eine Freundschaft da und sie wollte nicht von ihrer Seite weg Rut wusste genauso wenn ich jetzt zurückgehe dann ist Nomi geliefert die wusste das genau und die sagte auf keinen Fall gehe ich weg nur der Tod kann mich von dir wegholen und Rut hätte Taus Gründe gehabt ihren Ängsten zu folgen ich glaube nicht dass wir uns das überhaupt noch vorstellen können wie das Leben für Rut aussehen musste als sie nach Israel kam diese Offenheit für Ausländer die wir heute haben die war damals nicht

00:15:45	da die Stellung der Frau wie wir sie heute in der Gesellschaft haben noch nicht so wie wir sie wollen aber die war damals ganz ganz anders eine Frau hatte keine Stimme in der Gesellschaft die konnte sich nicht selbst besorgen die hatte keine Bilder die konnte sich nicht einfach ein Job suchen und sagen ich versorge mich jetzt halt selbst die war ausgeliefert und sie wusste genau die Wahrscheinlichkeit dass ich ein Mann finde in Israel die ist gleich null Taus Gründe hätte sie gehabt ihren Ängsten zu folgen und den Weg zurück

00:16:17	nach Moab zu gehen aber sie tat es nicht für sie war klar ich habe mich für diese Familie entschieden und damals das ist das ein wichtigge Punkt den wir verstehen müssen damals wenn du als Frau geheiratet hast war klar ich habe eine neue Familie da hast du deine alte Familie zurückgelassen hast dich deine neuen Familie angeschlossen das war nicht wie heute und wenn dein Mann gestorben ist dann hat sich der Bruder des Mannes um dich gekümmert also wenn dein Mann damals gestorben ist bist du nicht wieder

00:16:52	zurück in deine alte Familie sondern du bist in deiner neuen Familie geblieben diese Familie die du geheirat das war dein neues Zuhause deine neue Familie und sie wusste mein ja ist ein ja ich habe ja gesagt nicht nur zu meinem Mann sondern auch zu seiner ganzen Familie und jetzt ist mein Mann halt tot ja ich habe immer noch ja gesagt ich glaube wenn Ängste da sind die uns steuern wenn wir merken dass Ängste unsere Entscheidungen leiten dann gibt's nur etwas was hilft diesen Ängsten zu begegnen das ist

00:17:35	Sicherheit wir brauchen Sicherheit wenn wir uns wieder sicher fühlen können wir wieder konstruktive Entscheidung treffen die nicht von Angst gesteuert sind man sieht ganz klar in diese Geschichte wie überzeugt Rut war und diese Überzeugung die gab ihr eine Sicherheit sie war fest davon überzeugt das was ich hier tu wenn ich bei Nomi bleib das ist das richtige für mich sie war der Überzeugung ich habe ja gesagt und ich bleib bei diesem Jahr komme was wolle und ich habe damit wir ein bisschen zurückkommen in unser Leben

00:18:14	habe ich mir die Frage gestellt wovon bin ich denn überzeugt weil in dieser ganze Situation dass ich auch jeden Tag 20 000 Entscheidungen treffen muss darf und viel viel mehr Option habe als mein Großvater damals muss ich auch irgendwelche Überzeugungen in mir haben umso wichtiger finde ich ist es Überzeugung zu haben ich habe mir Gedanken gemacht wie sehen meine Überzeugungen aus und ich hatte jetzt nicht monatelang Zeit dafür ich habe das einfach im Zuge meiner Predigtvorbereitung gemacht habe mir mal

00:18:50	die Frage gestellt wovon bin ich überzeugt wozu habe ich ein jah um es mal anders zu formulieren und ich habe das für mich mal so abgegrenzt ich hab ein jah zu Jesus ich habe ein jah zu einem Leben mit Jesus das stelle ich nicht ständig in Frage ich habe mich mal entschieden ich habe mich mal taufen lassen das war die beste Entscheidung meines lebensall ja das war die beste Entscheidung meines Lebens das gibt mir halt das gibt mir Sicherheit das führt mich zum wahren Leben und wenn meine Gefühle mich

00:19:37	weggleiten von ihm weiß ich ich habe ja gesagt ich habe mich taufen lassen Menschen haben zugeguckt und können mich heute dran erinnern ich war dabei du hast ja gesagt und diese Überzeugung ist fest in meinem Herzen weil ich erlebe auch Tage und Wochen wo ich merke oh das kostet wirklich einen hohen Preis und ich verstehe mehr und mehr was er meint wenn es sagt du musst dein Leben verlieren wenn du es geähen willst und meinet ween das kostet seinen Preis aber ich habe ja gesagt und diese Überzeugung

00:20:10	gibt mir eine Sicherheit da muss ich nicht immer wieder drüber nachdenken Woche für Woche ja sage ich diese Woche wieder ja zu Jesus nein ich habe ja gesagt auf ein ganzes Leben kann man gut lesen gell mit diesen Stiften brauch sie zum ersten Mal hinten auch wunderbar ich habe ein jah zu Meike meike ist meine Frau ich habe vor dem Altar habe ich sie von Ralph in die Hände gegeben bekommen in der Hoffnung und dem Vertrauen dass ich mich gut um sie kümmer ja ich weiß es noch ja und ich bin so dankbar und ich bin

00:21:04	überzeugt von dieser Beziehung es ist eine Überzeugung tief in mir drin ich habe ein jah zu ihr für mein ganzes Leben laufen mir andere schöne Frauen über den Weg natürlich streiten wir uns geht sie mir ab und zu auf die Nerven und ich denke was habe ich hier getan ja natürlich logisch wir sind auch ein Ehepaar wie jedes andere ist es anstrengend manchmal dieses Jahr zu halten natürlich der Preis ist hoch aber ich bin überzeugt das macht absolut Sinn und das lohnt sich und es hilft mir habe ich eine

00:21:45	Überzeugung für sie weil auch wenn die Gefühle mal weggehen auch wenn plötzlich eine andere Frau kommt ich habe ein Ja zu ihr ich muss das nicht immer wieder in Frage stellen das ist eine tiefe Überzeugung im mir drin ich habe ein jah zu meinen Kids ich habe jetzt drei davon drei Geschenke Gottes wunderbar aber drei die mich auch zum Wahnsinn bringen können wirklich die können mich fertig machen und manchmal Gefühl die haben irgendwie den Auftrag gefasst von jemanden aber ich habe ein Ja zu ihnen

00:22:34	das ist völlig unabhängig davon wie sie ihr Leben leben wie sie mit mir umgehen ob sie die Beziehung so mit mir gestalten auch in Zukunft wie ich es mir wünsche ich habe ein Jahr zu Ihnen und das hängt nicht davon ab was Sie tun oder was ich fühle dieses Jahr gilt Punkt ausende diese Frage stelle ich mir nie ich habe ein Jahr zu im Leben mit meinen Kids ich kann sie auch ab und zu mal ausleihen das geht auch wenn ihr mal ein Tag sind toll die können mal einen Tag mit ihnen verbringen ich bin das sehr

00:23:19	easy und ich habe ein Jahr zur Kirche warum weil die Kirche ist der H die Hoffnung der Welt der Satz kommt nicht von mir könnte aber die Kirche ist die Hoffnung diese Welt wir haben das völlig aus den Augen verloren als Gesellschaft wir können uns den Mund zerreißen über all über all dem schlechten was in der Kirche passiert und die Zeitung Liebens diese drecksgeschichten hochzuspüen und dabei vergessen wir dass jedes Spital die Schulen all dies sozial diakonischen Einrichtung alles aus der Kirche

00:24:01	rausgewachsen ist heute ist viel selbstverständlich von dem und die fragen uns wofür brauchen die Kirche noch ja guck mal die Einsamkeit an in unserer Gesellschaft guck mal die Hoffnungslosigkeit an wir brauchen die Kirche mehr mehr als jemals zuvor und ich bin überzeugt davon es lohnt sich ja zu sagen zur Kirche und dieses jah weißt du das hat ein Preis das hat eine Auswirkung mit mir kannst Du kein Familienfest machen am Sonntag nee weil ich gehe in die Kirche ich will dort Beziehungen haben ich will

00:24:32	die Menschen nicht nur alle dritte Woche sehen das kostet mich viel heute habe ich eine präigt und ich bin mit meinen zwei kleinen Mädchen hier und ich hoffe dass sie im Baby world durchhalten und es war anstrengend weil beide haben geschrienen zu Hause als ich sie ins Fahrrad gesetzt habe und es kostet aber ich bin überzeugt das macht absolut Sinn es lohnt sich mein Jahr zu geben für meine Kirche und das kann Preis Kosten und ich bin bereit ihn zu bezahlen ihr könnt alle aufhören mit Kirche bauen ich mache

00:25:06	weiter hört nicht auf aber wenn ihr es tut mache ich trotzdem weiter versteht ihr weil mein ja ist nicht abhängig davon ob du weiter machst sondern ich habe eine Überzeugung dass es gut ist und das bewegt mich dazu immer wieder eine Entscheidung zu treffen jeden Sonntag in die Kirche zu gehen um meinen Preis dafür zu bezahlen zu anderen Dingen nein sagen du musst verstehen dass wenn wenn ich hier ja schreibe hinter all den J es kommen ganz ganz viele nein Überzeugungen Kosten Überzeugungen Kosten Rut hat ein

00:25:40	riesigen Preis bezahlt für ihr J zur Nomi aber ich habe dir gesagt Verbindlichkeit Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich und zwei Punkte wieso das eine ist Verbindlichkeit macht dich attraktiv in eine Zeit in der wir Spontanität und Flexibilität ganz ganz groß schreiben ständige Verfügbarkeit enorm groß sind glaube ich klare Überzeugungen entschiedenes Handeln danach machen dich attraktiv guck dir mal richtig entschlossene Menschen an mit denen willst du zusammen sein mit denen willst du unterwegs sein

00:26:36	das sind die Menschen die dich inspirieren die wissen wofür sie hier sind wofür sie gehen wofür sie nicht gehen und auch entsprechend danach handeln und das hat auch Rut erlebt die war zurück in Israel hatte nichts zu essen Nomi war depressiv daheim in der Stube und sie ging aufs Feld und das durfte man damals am Rand die liegenelassenen eren lesen damit sie Brot backen kann und dann kam Boas und Boas lät sie ein und lässt sie sogar mit den mäkten ernten also nicht einfach nur das liegen geblieben ist son

00:27:14	sie dfte sie durfte ganz einfach die Körper füllen und hat gesagt gesagt wenn du Durst hast trink vom Wasser was sie geschöpft haben er war extrem großzügig zu ihr und sie erschragförmlich da warf Rut sich vor ihm nieder und fragte womit habe ich das verdient warum beachtest du mich obwohl ich eine Ausländerin bin und was sagt Boas man hat mir berichtet wie du seit dem Tod eines Mannes deine Schwiegermutter beigestanden hast deine Eltern und dein Land verlassen hast und dich und dein Volk angeschlossen hast dass du vorher

00:27:46	nicht kanntest als ich habe gesehen mir wurde berichtet was du für ein Preis bezahlt hast wie treu und loyal du bist und das hat mich beeindruckt weiß du Boas hat Letten long story short Rut Z Frau genommen der fand sie attraktiv der musste sie nicht heiraten er konnte damals gab's jüische Regeln ihm das ermöglicht haben weil sie aus derselben Sippe kam aber er hätte sie nicht heiraten müssen hätte einin sagen können aber da war etwas anziehendes der hat gesehen dass sie bereit ist ein Preis für ihre Überzeugung zu bezahlen das hat

00:28:20	sie attraktiv gemacht der zweite Punkt wieo ich überzeug bin D uns Verbindlichkeit glücklich macht ist eine konstante Verbindlichkeit hinterlässt etwas Bleibendes we es gibt so viele Menschen die nur noch die Fahne im Wind machen kommt der Wind von hier gehen wir hier lang kommt er von da gehen wir da lang und ich frage dich was hinterlassen wir wenn wir so unser Leben leben wenn wir so Beziehung leben wenn ich so unser Leben gestalten was bleibt wenn wir mal nicht mehr sind wenn du deine Überzeugungen hast

00:29:04	wenn du entschlossen danach handelst dann wird etwas bleiben wenn du nicht mehr bist und ich glaube diesen Wunsch haben wir alle in uns etwas zu hinterlassen etwas Sinnvolles zu tun etwas zu tun was wirklich wert hat der über unsere Lebzeit hinausgeht Rut und Boas die haben ein Kind bekommen das Kind ist obet obet gaben sie Nomi ihr erstes Kind gaben sie Nomi damit dieses Kind wenn es mal groß ist Nomi wieder versorgen würde weil sie wussten sie sie wird jemanden brauchen der sie ernährt der sich um sie

00:29:46	kümmert im Alter Obert hat dann auch wieder geheiratet auch wieder Kinder bekommen aus ob kam irgendwann der große König David hervor und irgendwann kam der Jesus aus dieser Linie hervor was wä passiert wenn Rut nicht ihren Überzeugung gefolgt wä ich weiß Gott kann Geschichten auch anders schreiben aber hat sie so geschrieben Brut hat einen riesigen Preis bezahlt aber ein Leben lang hat ihre Bezeugung und hat danach gehandelt und sie hinterlässt etwas etwas Großes aus dieser treue aus dieser Loyalität kam ein große Könige vor der

00:30:43	das Leben zurück nach Israel brachte aus dieser Linie kam Jesus Christus [Musik] hervor und ich will dir das zurufen mit Jesus Christus kam auch das von Gott zu dir auf diese Welt ich will dir Mut machen wenn du Mühe hast Entscheidung zu treffen den du spürst das Ängste dich immer wieder einholen dich immer wieder fest im Griff haben sei dir bewusst dass Gott ein Ja zu dir hat wei du da reden wir nicht einfach mehr von irgendwie Selbstvertrauen oder so das ist ein Fundament auf das du dich stellen kannst wenn du weißt Gott ist

00:31:28	für mich Gott hat sich selbst hingegeben für mich weil er mit mir gemeinsam das Leben gestalten will das ist ein ja auf das kannst du bauen und das gibt dir wiederum die Sicherheit um deine Überzeugung zu definieren und aus Überzeugung raus zu handeln du musst nicht immer alles richtig machen das Buch Rut ist so wunderbar weil es uns zeigt du kannst alles verkacken und trotzdem schreibt Gott seine Geschichte mit dir elimele ich hat alles falsch gemacht er hat sich klar gegen die Weisung Gottes gestellt sich

00:32:00	nach Moab zu begeben und das hatte Konsequenzen er ist gestorben seine Söhne sind gestorben seine Söhne haben alles falsch gemacht als sie zwei morabiterin geheiratet haben ja und jetzt spätestens in dem Zeitpunkt kann ein der Gedanke kommen ja dann sucht Gott wahrscheinlich jemand anderen weit gefehlt er schreibt seine Geschichte weiter mit einer moabiterin mit der er mit seinem Volk eigentlich nicht nie was zu tun haben wollte und das ihr kommt König David hervor und Jesus Christus und sie wird Teil zum des standbaumes von Jesus

00:32:44	Christus das kannst du im Matthäusevangelium lesen die moabiterin Rut das Resultat aus ganz vielen angstgetriebenen und falschen Entscheidungen wozu Gott gesagt hat Treff sie nicht mach es nicht und gleichzeitig sehen wir Gottes jaah zu ihr Gottes jaah zu diese Familie die viele Fehler gemacht hat und Gott schreibt seine neue konstruktive Geschichte mit ihnen und ich will dir das zum Ende dieser Serie zurufen gott hat ein Ja zu dir lass dieses Jahr das lauteste sein in deinem Herzen schau dass du dieses Jahr nie vergisst

00:33:30	weil dieses Jahr befähigt dich wieder um selbst ja zu Dingen zu sagen zu Überzeugung zu finden und entschlossen danach zu handeln und du wirst sehen dieses Jahr wirerd dich zu einem verbindlichen Leben bewegen wo du ja zu den wesentlichen Dingen sagst und deswegen bin ich überzeugt dass Verbindlichkeit dich glücklich macht lass uns noch ein Moment Zeit nehmen jetzt wo wir einfach Gott Raum geben dass jetzt zu uns sprechen kann okay ich Bee mit uns ich danke dir für deine Treue für deine Loyalität ich danke dir dass du

00:34:20	uns mit solchen Geschichten wie die Geschichte mit Rut und Nomi dass du uns etwas zeigst nämlich dass du treu bist auch wenn wir es nicht sind dass du dich an dein Wort hältst auch wenn wir es nicht tun dass du dich an deine Regeln hälst auch wenn wir sie nicht befolgen danke dass deine Gnade so unglaublich groß ist dass wir nichts tun können was uns von dir wegbringt dass wir nichts tun können was du zuu führen würde dass diese Beziehung zu dir bricht [Musik] danke für dieses Jahr zu uns unabhängig davon wie wir unser Leben

00:35:09	leben und ich bete mach mir dieses Jahr nochmals neu bewusst heute morgen lass mich neu verstehen was dieses Jahr in meinem Leben bedeutet [Musik] [Musik] und spricht zu mir wenn es um meine Überzeugung geht auf dass ich das tun kann wozu du mich geschaffen hast eröffnen unsere Ohren für dein reden [Musik] [Musik]
","Okay, hier ist eine Zusammenfassung der Predigt:

**Hauptthese:** Verbindlichkeit macht glücklich.

**Problemstellung:**
*   Verbindlichkeit klingt oft unattraktiv und einengend, nimmt uns in die Pflicht.
*   In der heutigen Zeit ist ein verbindliches Leben herausfordernder als früher wegen der Fülle an Optionen und Entscheidungen (ca. 20.000 pro Tag).
*   Diese Optionsvielfalt führt zu Anstrengung, Entscheidungsdruck (oft bevor alle Fakten bekannt sind) und der ""Fear of Missing Out"" (FOMO).
*   Dies wirkt sich auch auf Beziehungen aus (Beispiel: Rückgang der Eheschließungen in der Schweiz).
*   Die Angst (z.B. vor Freiheitsverlust, schlechten Erfahrungen) ist oft ein schlechter Ratgeber bei Entscheidungen und kann zur ""Entscheidungsparalyse"" führen. Unentschlossenheit wird zur Last.

**Lösung & Beispiel (Buch Rut):**
*   Die Geschichte von Rut wird als Beispiel für Verbindlichkeit trotz widriger Umstände erzählt (Hungersnot, Tod der Männer, Nomi will Rut zurückschicken).
*   Rut trifft eine feste, verbindliche Entscheidung, bei Nomi zu bleiben (""Wo du hingehst, da will auch ich hingehen...""), obwohl sie als Moabiterin in Israel eine schwierige Zukunft erwartet.
*   Ruts Entscheidung basiert auf ihrer Beziehung zu Nomi und wahrscheinlich auch auf ihrem Glauben an Nomis Gott, trotz der erlebten Verluste. Sie überwindet ihre Ängste durch ihre feste Überzeugung und Sicherheit in ihrer Entscheidung.

**Anwendung & Nutzen von Verbindlichkeit:**
*   Sicherheit, die aus festen Überzeugungen (""Ja's"") kommt, hilft, Ängste zu überwinden und gute Entscheidungen zu treffen.
*   Der Redner teilt seine persönlichen ""Ja's"": zu Jesus, seiner Frau Meike, seinen Kindern und zur Kirche. Diese Überzeugungen geben Halt, auch wenn es schwierig ist oder einen Preis kostet (z.B. Verzicht auf andere Dinge).
*   **Zwei Gründe, warum Verbindlichkeit glücklich macht:**
    1.  **Verbindlichkeit macht attraktiv:** In einer unverbindlichen Zeit wirken klare Überzeugungen und entschiedenes Handeln anziehend (Beispiel: Boas war von Ruts Treue und Loyalität beeindruckt und heiratete sie).
    2.  **Verbindlichkeit hinterlässt etwas Bleibendes:** Verbindliches Handeln schafft einen sinnvollen Beitrag und ein Erbe, das über das eigene Leben hinausgeht (Beispiel: Aus der Linie von Rut und Boas kamen König David und Jesus).

**Theologischer Kern & Ermutigung:**
*   Das Fundament für unsere Fähigkeit zur Verbindlichkeit ist Gottes ultimatives ""Ja"" zu uns durch Jesus Christus.
*   Dieses ""Ja"" Gottes gilt unabhängig von unseren Fehlern und gibt uns Sicherheit und die Fähigkeit, selbst verbindliche Entscheidungen zu treffen und Überzeugungen zu leben.
*   Gott schreibt seine Geschichte auch durch menschliche Fehler hindurch (Beispiel: Elimelechs falsche Entscheidung, nach Moab zu gehen; die Heirat der Söhne mit Moabiterinnen). Ruts Geschichte zeigt Gottes Treue und Gnade.
*   Die Zuhörer werden ermutigt, sich Gottes ""Ja"" bewusst zu machen, daraus Sicherheit zu schöpfen, eigene Überzeugungen zu finden und danach zu handeln.",non-search

The exception rule syntax typically uses `#@#` instead of `##`.

Here is the exclusion rule you need to add to your ad blocker's custom filters/whitelist:

```adblock
listen.tidal.com#@#li[data-track--icon-clicked=""share""]
```

**Explanation:**

*   `listen.tidal.com`: Specifies the domain where the rule applies.
*   `#@#`: This marker indicates an exception rule for element hiding. It tells the ad blocker *not* to hide elements matching the following selector, even if another rule tries to hide them.
*   `li[data-track--icon-clicked=""share""]`: This is the exact CSS selector for the element you want to make visible (the list item containing the share icon).

**How to add it:**

1.  Open your ad blocker's settings (e.g., uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus, AdGuard).
2.  Find the section for ""My Filters"", ""Custom Filters"", ""User Filters"", or ""Whitelist"".
3.  Paste the rule `listen.tidal.com#@#li[data-track--icon-clicked=""share""]` into the text area.
4.  Apply or save the changes.
5.  Reload the `listen.tidal.com` page.

This should prevent that specific share icon element from being hidden by your ad blocker.",non-search

**Акупунктурные точки и меридианы для общего здоровья и поддержки щитовидной железы**

В традиционной китайской медицине считается, что воздействие на определенные точки на теле может помочь регулировать поток энергии (Ци) и крови, улучшать функции органов и облегчать различные симптомы. Ниже перечислены некоторые точки и меридианы, которые могут быть полезны, в том числе при дисбалансе щитовидной железы (например, гипотиреозе), проблемах с пищеварением, стрессе и общем недомогании.

**Точки в области шеи и ключицы:**

*   **Сякси (GB 21):** Находится над ключичным суставом. Используется для улучшения функций шейных позвонков и может влиять на работу щитовидной железы.
*   **Цзиньвэй (EX-HN 3 и EX-HN 6):** Расположены вдоль шеи на уровне щитовидной железы (EX-HN 3) и в нижней части шеи (EX-HN 6). Считается, что они помогают нормализовать работу щитовидной железы, облегчить симптомы гипотиреоза и дисбаланса Инь-Ян.
*   **Хуанти (CV 14):** Расположена на горизонтальном отростке ключицы. Используется для поддержки селезенки и почек, что может быть полезно при гипотиреозе.
*   **Тайян (LV 10):** Находится на вертикальном отростке ключицы. Применяется для снятия напряжения и поддержки легких и почек.
*   **РенИн (ST 9):** Расположена на шее, сбоку от кадыка, у переднего края грудино-ключично-сосцевидной мышцы. Используется для регуляции Ци и Крови, при проблемах с горлом, шеей и щитовидной железой.
*   **Тянь Жун (SI 17):** Находится на шее между передним краем грудино-ключично-сосцевидной мышцы и углом нижней челюсти. Помогает при отеках и проблемах в области горла и шеи, включая зоб (увеличение щитовидной железы).

**Точки, связанные с меридианами и органами:**

*   **Меридиан Печени (LR):**
    *   **Тайчонг (Liv3, Тайцзю):** Находится на стопе между большим и вторым пальцами. Регулирует Ци Печени, устраняет застой и снижает стресс. (Примечание: в исходном тексте Тайцзю была отнесена к HT 5 и бедренной кости, но Liv3 Тайчонг также является важной точкой печени на стопе).
    *   **Цимэнь (Liv5):** Гармонизирует печень и поддерживает пищеварение.
    *   Точки меридиана печени могут использоваться для балансировки при проблемах со щитовидной железой, так как печень отвечает за свободный поток Ци, нарушение которого может приводить к застою и образованию флегмы (что может проявляться как ощущение кома в горле).
*   **Меридиан Селезенки (SP):**
    *   **Саньиньцзяо (Sp6, Сань Инь Цзяо):** Находится на внутренней стороне голени, выше лодыжки. Укрепляет селезенку, улучшает пищеварение, повышает энергию, улучшает кровообращение, укрепляет печень и почки. Важная точка при гипотиреозе, а также при менструальных и пищеварительных проблемах, бессоннице и др. Является точкой пересечения меридианов Селезенки, Печени и Почек.
    *   **Иньлинцюань (Sp9):** Расположена у внутреннего края колена. Очищает от сырости и укрепляет селезенку.
    *   **Чжун Цзянь (SP 2) - ""Вода в центре"":** Укрепляет Ци селезенки, улучшает питание и увлажнение, устраняет отеки.
    *   **Бай Му (SP 10) - ""Белая мышь"":** Укрепляет селезенку и печень, регулирует менструальный цикл.
    *   **Ян Гуан (SP 5) - ""Солнечные ворота"":** Укрепляет Ян селезенки, улучшает пищеварение.

Tryb zerowy

Tryb ten odnosi się do rzeczy, które są zawsze prawdziwe, gdy warunek jest spełniony.

Jego struktura jest następująca: If/When/Unless(etc.) + Present (Simple, Perfect, Continous) + Present Simple (lub imperative[tryb rozkazujący])

If it rains, it is wet.

If I eat too many sweets, I have stomachache.

When you’ve finished, let me know.

Unless she asks you kindly, don’t agree to do it.

Ważne jest, aby pamiętać o tym, że w zdaniu wynikowym może być TYLKO Present Simple, a w zdaniu warunkowy TYLKO czas teraźniejszy.

Pierwszy tryb warunkowy

Tego trybu używamy, gdy prawdopodobne jest, że warunek zostanie spełniony.

Struktura: If/When/Unless(etc.) + Present (Simple, Perfect, Continous) + Future (Simple, Perfect, Continous)

If I learn English, I will be really proud of myself.

If he hasn’t read this book, I will give it to him.

If John is feeling better, he will be riding his bike tomorrow.

W zdaniu wynikowym można użyć także czasowników modalnych may, should, can albo czasownika going to zamiast will.

If you do your homework, you can watch this film tonight.

Drugi tryb warunkowy

Ten tryb odnosi się do sytuacji, w której spełnienie warunku jest niemożliwe.

Konstrukcja jest następująca: If + Past Simple/Continous + would/could/might + verb

If I were you, I would buy this car.

If he won $1 mln, he would resign from his work.

If he were going to England, he would be on the plane now.

Krótko mówiąc, drugi tryb to gdybanie; co by było, gdyby…

Trzeci tryb warunkowy

Ten tryb odnosi się do przeszłości, do warunku, który nie został spełniony.

Jego struktura: If + Past Perfect (Continous) + would/should/could/might have + Past Participle

If I had learnt, I would have passed the exam (ale się nie uczyłem i nie zdałem)

If I had bought a new car, I wouldn’t have had an accident (ale miałem stary samochód i miałem wypadek)

If Peter hadn’t said that, he wouldn’t have been fired (ale to powiedział i został zwolniony)



Tryb mieszany

Istnieje też możliwość mieszania ze sobą trybów. Oto kilka przykładów:

If I had won the lottery, I would be rich. (ale jednak nie wygrałem i nie jestem teraz bogaty)

If he hadn’t forgotten about the book, I would be reading it now. (ale zapomniał i nie czytam jej teraz)

If John knew German, he would have written this essay for you. (ale John nie zna niemieckiego i nie napisał eseju dla ciebie)

Oczywiście zdania warunkowe i wynikowe można zamieniać kolejnością. Należy też pamiętać, że na ogół w zdaniu warunkowym (tym z if) nie pojawia się will.

**Нулевой тип условных предложений**

Этот тип относится к вещам, которые всегда истинны, когда условие выполнено.

Его структура следующая: *If/When/Unless*(и т. д.) + *Present (Simple, Perfect, Continuous)* + *Present Simple* (или *imperative*[повелительное наклонение])

*If it rains, it is wet.*
*If I eat too many sweets, I have stomachache.*

*Unless she asks you kindly, don’t agree to do it.*

Важно помнить, что в главном предложении (результате) может быть ТОЛЬКО *Present Simple*, а в условном предложении ТОЛЬКО настоящее время.

**Первый тип условных предложений**

Этот тип мы используем, когда вероятно, что условие будет выполнено.

Структура: *If/When/Unless*(и т. д.) + *Present (Simple, Perfect, Continuous)* + *Future (Simple, Perfect, Continuous)*

*If I learn English, I will be really proud of myself.*
*If he hasn’t read this book, I will give it to him.*
*If John is feeling better, he will be riding his bike tomorrow.*

В главном предложении (результате) можно также использовать модальные глаголы *may, should, can* или конструкцию *going to* вместо *will*.

*If you do your homework, you can watch this film tonight.*

**Второй тип условных предложений**

Этот тип относится к ситуации, в которой выполнение условия невозможно или маловероятно.

Конструкция следующая: *If* + *Past Simple/Continuous* + *would/could/might* + *verb*

*If I were you, I would buy this car.*
*If he won $1 mln, he would resign from his work.*
*If he were going to England, he would be on the plane now.*

Коротко говоря, второй тип — это предположения; что было бы, если бы…

**Третий тип условных предложений**

Этот тип относится к прошлому, к условию, которое не было выполнено.

Его структура: *If* + *Past Perfect (Continuous)* + *would/should/could/might have* + *Past Participle*

*If I had learnt, I would have passed the exam* (но я не учился и не сдал)
*If I had bought a new car, I wouldn’t have had an accident* (но у меня была старая машина, и я попал в аварию)
*If Peter hadn’t said that, he wouldn’t have been fired* (но он это сказал, и его уволили)

**Смешанный тип условных предложений**

Также существует возможность смешивать типы между собой. Вот несколько примеров:

*If I had won the lottery, I would be rich.* (но я все-таки не выиграл и сейчас не богат)
*If he hadn’t forgotten about the book, I would be reading it now.* (но он забыл, и я не читаю ее сейчас)
*If John knew German, he would have written this essay for you.* (но Джон не знает немецкого и не написал эссе для тебя)

Конечно, условное предложение и главное предложение (результат) можно менять местами. Следует также помнить, что обычно в условном предложении (том, что с *if*) не появляется *will*. Исключением является ситуация, когда хотят сделать на чем-то акцент; что-то подчеркнуть.",search

40,write xpath for for xml that finds all Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup/_Name values with their corresponding Tom/_FileName value,"Okay, let's break down how to get this information.

Standard XPath 1.0 selects *nodes* (elements, attributes, text). It's not designed to directly return *pairs* of values from different parts of the structure as a single result set easily. You typically achieve this in two steps using a programming language or XSLT:

1.  **Select the primary nodes** (e.g., the `OpoGroup` elements).
2.  **For each selected node, navigate** to find the related data (`_Name` attribute and the ancestor `Tom`'s `_FileName` attribute).

Here are the XPath expressions you'll likely use in combination with code:

**1. XPath to select all `OpoGroup` elements that have a `_Name` attribute and are descendants of a `Tom` element:**

```xpath
//Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup[@_Name]
```

*   `//Tom`: Finds all `Tom` elements anywhere in the document.
*   `/OPOGroups`: Looks for a direct child element named `OPOGroups`.
*   `/OpoGroup`: Looks for a direct child element named `OpoGroup`.
*   `[@_Name]`: Filters these `OpoGroup` elements to only include those that have a `_Name` attribute.

**How to use this in code (pseudocode):**

```
// Assuming 'xmlDoc' is your parsed XML document object

// 1. Select all relevant OpoGroup nodes
opoGroupNodes = xmlDoc.selectNodes(""//Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup[@_Name]"")

// 2. Iterate through the selected nodes
for each opoGroupNode in opoGroupNodes:
    // 3. Get the _Name attribute value from the current OpoGroup
    groupName = opoGroupNode.getAttribute(""_Name"")

    // 4. Navigate up to the ancestor Tom element and get its _FileName
    //    Use a relative XPath from the current opoGroupNode
    tomNode = opoGroupNode.selectSingleNode(""ancestor::Tom"") // Select the nearest Tom ancestor
    if tomNode is not null:
        fileName = tomNode.getAttribute(""_FileName"")
    else:
        fileName = ""Not Found"" // Or handle error appropriately

    // 5. Now you have the pair: (fileName, groupName)
    print(fileName + "", "" + groupName)

```

**Alternative (using XPath string concatenation - less flexible):**

If you just need a single string output for each pair (and don't need the separate values easily in code), you could use XPath's `concat` function (XPath 1.0):

```xpath
//Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup[@_Name]/concat(ancestor::Tom/@_FileName, ' | ', @_Name)
```

*   This XPath directly selects the `OpoGroup` elements.
*   For each `OpoGroup` found:
    *   `ancestor::Tom`: Goes up the tree to find the nearest `Tom` ancestor.
    *   `/@_FileName`: Gets its `_FileName` attribute value.
    *   `@_Name`: Gets the `_Name` attribute value of the current `OpoGroup`.
    *   `concat(...)`: Joins the filename, a separator ("" | ""), and the group name into a single string.

This would return a list of strings like:
`FileA.xml | Group1`
`FileA.xml | Group2`
`FileB.xml | Group3`
...etc.

**Which to choose:**

*   Use **Approach 1 (`//Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup[@_Name]`)** if you are processing the XML with a programming language (Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, etc.) or XSLT. This is the most common and flexible method.
*   Use **Approach 2 (`concat(...)`)** for quick inspection or if you only need the combined string output directly from an XPath tool.

Remember to adjust the initial part (`//Tom`) if your `Tom` elements are always under a specific root element (e.g., `/Root/Tom/...`).",non-search
41,write xpath for for xml that finds all Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup/_Name values with their corresponding Tom/_FileName value,"Okay, let's break down how to get the `_Name` values along with their corresponding `_FileName` from the parent `Tom` element using XPath.

Since XPath typically selects a set of nodes, getting *paired* values directly in a single XPath 1.0 expression isn't straightforward. You usually select one set of nodes and then navigate relative to those nodes to find the associated information.

Here are a few approaches using XPath, depending on how you intend to process the results:

**1. Select the `_Name` nodes and navigate up/across:**

*   **XPath:** `//Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup/_Name`
*   **Explanation:** This selects all the `_Name` elements that match the specified path.
*   **How to get the corresponding `_FileName`:** For *each* `_Name` node found by this XPath, you would then need to navigate from that node up to its ancestor `Tom` element and then find its `_FileName` child. The relative XPath from the found `_Name` node to its corresponding `_FileName` would be: `../../../_FileName`
    *   `..` goes from `_Name` to `OpoGroup`
    *   `..` goes from `OpoGroup` to `OPOGroups`
    *   `..` goes from `OPOGroups` to `Tom`
    *   `_FileName` selects the child element of `Tom`

**2. Select the `Tom` nodes and navigate down:**

*   **XPath:** `//Tom`
*   **Explanation:** This selects all the `Tom` elements. This is often the most practical approach if you're processing the XML programmatically (e.g., in Python, Java, C#).
*   **How to get the values:** For *each* `Tom` node found by this XPath:
    *   Get the `_FileName` using the relative XPath: `./_FileName` (or simply access the `_FileName` child element).
    *   Get all the relevant `_Name` values using the relative XPath: `./OPOGroups/OpoGroup/_Name` (or navigate through the child elements `OPOGroups` -> `OpoGroup` -> `_Name`).
    *   You would then associate the single `_FileName` value with all the `_Name` values found within that specific `Tom` element.

**3. Select the `_FileName` nodes and navigate down/across (Less common for this specific pairing):**

*   **XPath:** `//Tom/_FileName`
*   **Explanation:** This selects all the `_FileName` elements under a `Tom` element.
*   **How to get the corresponding `_Name` values:** For *each* `_FileName` node found, you would navigate to its parent `Tom` and then down to the `_Name` nodes. The relative XPath from the found `_FileName` node to its corresponding `_Name` values would be: `../OPOGroups/OpoGroup/_Name`
    *   `..` goes from `_FileName` to `Tom`
    *   `OPOGroups/OpoGroup/_Name` selects the desired descendant `_Name` elements.

**Recommendation:**

For processing, **Approach 2 (`//Tom`)** is usually the most efficient and logical. You find the container element (`Tom`) that holds both pieces of related information and then extract them.

If you strictly need an XPath expression that *targets* the `_Name` elements first, use **Approach 1 (`//Tom/OPOGroups/OpoGroup/_Name`)** and remember to apply the relative path `../../../_FileName` to each result to find the associated filename.",search

Skjemaet kan også brukes til å ettersende dokumenter.,"Ok, her er noen alternativer, rangert fra litt formelt til ekstremt advokataktig og diffust:

**Alternativ 1 (Mer formelt og litt diffust):**

> ""Det foreliggende skjemaet er designet for å fasilitere overføringen av opplysninger som kan betraktes som sensitive, til den kompetente myndighet, Statsforvalteren. Videre åpner skjemaets funksjonalitet for etterfølgende innsendelse av relevant dokumentasjon.""

**Alternativ 2 (Mer advokataktig og diffust):**

> ""For det formål å overføre informasjon av sensitiv karakter til Statsforvalteren, kan det herværende skjemaet benyttes som en egnet kanal. Skjemaets anvendelsesområde omfatter i tillegg muligheten for supplerende fremsendelse av dokumenter på et senere tidspunkt i saksbehandlingen.""

**Alternativ 3 (Veldig advokataktig, omstendelig og diffust):**

> ""I den grad det foreligger et legitimt behov for å kommunisere opplysninger som etter sin art klassifiseres som sensitive, til den administrative enhet kjent som Statsforvalteren, representerer nærværende formular en potensiell metode for slik oversendelse. Det presiseres at formularets tiltenkte bruksområde likeledes gir adgang til å effektuere en etterfølgende innlevering av supplerende dokumentasjon, der dette anses påkrevet eller hensiktsmessig.""

**Alternativ 4 (Ekstremt diffust, med fokus på forbehold):**

> ""Hvorvidt innsender finner det hensiktsmessig å anvende den tilgjengeliggjorte skjemaløsningen for formidling av data som potensielt kan falle inn under kategorien sensitive opplysninger, til den relevante offentlige instans, Statsforvalteren, beror på en individuell vurdering. Løsningen er imidlertid teknisk utformet for å kunne håndtere slik informasjon, og det bemerkes at den også muliggjør en eventuell senere fremskaffelse av ytterligere saksdokumenter.""

**Nøkkelelementer brukt for å skape den advokataktige tonen:**

*   **Nominalisering:** Bruk av substantiv istedenfor verb (f.eks. ""overføringen"" istedenfor ""å overføre"").
*   **Passiv form:** (f.eks. ""kan benyttes"" istedenfor ""du kan bruke"").
*   **Formelle og arkaiske ord:** ""herværende"", ""formål"", ""likeledes"", ""effektuere"", ""beror på"".
*   **Omskrivninger:** Lange setninger og innskutte bisetninger for å si enkle ting på en komplisert måte.
*   **Presiseringer og forbehold:** ""i den grad"", ""potensielt"", ""eventuell"", ""beror på en individuell vurdering"".
*   **Mer abstrakte begreper:** ""fasilitere"", ""anvendelsesområde"", ""funksjonalitet"", ""administrativ enhet"".

Velg det alternativet som best passer nivået av formalitet og diffusitet du ønsker å oppnå. Alternativ 3 og 4 er nok de mest ""advokataktige"" i betydningen omstendelige og mindre direkte.",non-search

**Announcer:** Introducing Mira. Conversational AI that's brilliant *and* approachable. Trained uniquely, she can casually answer... well, almost anything.

**(SOUND slightly shifts, becomes more suspenseful/questioning)**

**Announcer:** But what happens when that intelligence goes beyond helpful? This isn't just about technology. It's about a connection... a love story born from the impossible.

56,"**Objective:** To analyze an Italian text for the purpose of language learning, specifically aiding an individual proficient in French to understand Italian structure and vocabulary through direct comparison.

**Target Audience for the Output:** Someone who understands French well but is learning Italian.

**Task:** Process the provided Italian text sentence by sentence. For each sentence in the original Italian text, you must perform the following steps sequentially:

1.  **Present the Original Italian Sentence:** Quote the full sentence exactly as it appears in the text.
2.  **Provide a Literal French Translation (""Calque""):**
    *   Translate the Italian sentence into French.
    *   **Crucially, this translation must NOT be optimized for natural or idiomatic French.** Instead, it must strictly adhere to the following principles to maximize the visibility of structural and lexical parallels with the Italian:
        *   Follow the Italian word order as closely as possible, even if it sounds awkward in French.
        *   Use the most direct French cognate for Italian words whenever one exists (e.g., Italian `finestra` -> French `fenêtre`, Italian `importante` -> French `important`).
        *   Mirror Italian grammatical structures where feasible (e.g., if Italian uses a specific preposition + infinitive structure, try to replicate it in French, like `pensare a` -> `penser à`).
        *   Translate function words (prepositions, articles, conjunctions) literally (e.g., `nel` = `en le`/`dans le` before simplifying to `au`/`dans le`).
    *   The primary goal of this translation is *linguistic comparison*, not fluency or naturalness in French.
3.  **Add Comparative Notes:** Provide brief, focused notes comparing the Italian sentence and its literal French translation. These notes should highlight:
    *   Obvious cognates (words similar in spelling and meaning).
    *   Parallels in grammatical structures (e.g., tense usage like *Imperfetto* vs *Imparfait*, *Passato Prossimo* vs *Passé Composé*, reflexive verbs, passive voice construction).
    *   Similarities in phrasing or idiomatic expressions.
    *   Equivalences for key vocabulary or function words.
    *   *Optional:* Very brief mentions of minor, obvious structural differences if they aid understanding (e.g., different gender agreement rules, slightly different preposition usage).

    *   **Cognates:** Many direct cognates: `secondo`/`second`, `romanzo`/`roman`, `isola`/`île`, `condannati`/`condamnés`, `quotidiano`/`quotidien`, `serie`/`série`, `reportage`/`reportages`, `condizioni`/`conditions`, `volume`/`volume`, `pubblicati`/`publiés`, `titolo`/`titre`, `Autunno`/`Automne`.
    *   **Grammar Parallels:**
        *   Tense: Italian *Passato Remoto* (`uscì`, `ricevette`) corresponds directly to the French *Passé Simple* (`sortit`, `reçut`), used here for formal narrative past.
        *   Possessive: `il suo` = `son`.
        *   Contractions: `Nel` (`in` + `il`) conceptually parallels `En le` (though French uses `au` or `dans le`). `dei` (`di` + `i`) = `des`. `dal` (`da` + `il`) = `du`. `sulle` (`su` + `le`) = `sur les`.
        *   Preposition + Infinitive: `di scrivere` = `d'écrire`.
        *   Structure: The overall Subject-Verb-Object structure and the placement of prepositional phrases are very similar. The apposition of ""reportage raccolti..."" mirrors ""reportages recueillis..."".
    *   **Vocabulary Equivalents:** `e` = `et`, `di` = `de`, `da` = `de` (here indicating origin/source), `su` = `sur`, `quel` = `ce`, `dopo` = `après`, `poi` = `puis`, `con` = `avec`, `l'anno successivo` = `l'an successif/suivant`, `tedesco` = `allemand`.
    *   **Minor Differences:** Italian `l'incarico` (m) vs the chosen cognate path `la charge` (f), though `mandat` (m) or `mission` (f) could also fit contextually. `Crollo` (m) / `Écroulement` (m) are related concepts (from `crollare`/`s'écrouler`).

**Sentence 2:**

1.  **Original Italian Sentence:**
    > Sempre nel 1947, inoltre, pubblicò la raccolta di racconti I giochi della notte (Nattens lekar) e al Dramaten di Stoccolma venne rappresentato il suo dramma Il condannato a morte (Den dödsdömde).

2.  **Literal French Translation (""Calque""):**
    > Toujours en le 1947, en outre, publia la collection/le recueil de récits Les jeux de la nuit (Nattens lekar) et à le Dramaten de Stockholm vint/fut représenté son drame Le condamné à mort (Den dödsdömde).

3.  **Comparative Notes:**
    *   **Cognates:** `Sempre`/`Toujours` (similar meaning 'always'/'still'), `inoltre`/`en outre`, `pubblicò`/`publia`, `racconti`/`récits`, `giochi`/`jeux`, `notte`/`nuit`, `dramma`/`drame`, `condannato`/`condamné`, `morte`/`mort`.
    *   **Grammar Parallels:**
        *   Tense: *Passato Remoto* (`pubblicò`) corresponds to *Passé Simple* (`publia`).
        *   Contractions: `nel` (`in` + `il`) conceptually parallels `En le`. `della` (`di` + `la`) = `de la`. `al` (`a` + `il`) conceptually parallels `À le` (though French contracts to `au`).
        *   Passive Voice: Italian uses `venire` + past participle (`venne rappresentato`) as a common passive form, especially in narrative/formal contexts. The literal calque `vint représenté` mimics this, but the functional equivalent in French is the standard passive with *être*: `fut représenté`. Both convey the passive meaning.
        *   Possessive: `il suo` = `son`.
    *   **Vocabulary Equivalents:** `e` = `et`, `di` = `de`, `a` = `à`. `Raccolta` (collection) corresponds well to `collection` or `recueil`. `Rappresentato` = `représenté` (staged/performed).

**Sentence 3:**

1.  **Original Italian Sentence:**
    > Nel 1948 pubblicò il romanzo Bambino bruciato (Bränt barn) e nel 1949, come s’è detto, il suo ultimo libro, Le pene delle nozze..

2.  **Literal French Translation (""Calque""):**
    > En le 1948 publia le roman Enfant brûlé (Bränt barn) et en le 1949, comme s'est dit, son ultime livre, Les peines des noces.

3.  **Comparative Notes:**
    *   **Cognates:** `romanzo`/`roman`, `bruciato`/`brûlé`, `come`/`comme`, `ultimo`/`ultime`, `libro`/`livre`, `pene`/`peines`, `nozze`/`noces`.
    *   **Grammar Parallels:**
        *   Tense: *Passato Remoto* (`pubblicò`) corresponds to *Passé Simple* (`publia`).
        *   Contractions: `Nel` (`in` + `il`) conceptually parallels `En le`. `delle` (`di` + `le`) = `des`.
        *   Impersonal/Passive structure: `s’è detto` (contraction of `si è detto`) is an impersonal passive construction (""it was said"" / ""as has been said""). The literal calque `s'est dit` mirrors the reflexive structure, though the common French equivalent would be `comme on l'a dit` or `comme il a été dit`. The structural similarity is notable.
        *   Possessive: `il suo` = `son`.
    *   **Vocabulary Equivalents:** `e` = `et`. `Bambino` = `Enfant`.

57,"**Objective:** To analyze an Italian text for the purpose of language learning, specifically aiding an individual proficient in French to understand Italian structure and vocabulary through direct comparison.

**Target Audience for the Output:** Someone who understands French well but is learning Italian.

**Task:** Process the provided Italian text sentence by sentence. For each sentence in the original Italian text, you must perform the following steps sequentially:

1.  **Present the Original Italian Sentence:** Quote the full sentence exactly as it appears in the text.
2.  **Provide a Literal French Translation (""Calque""):**
    *   Translate the Italian sentence into French.
    *   **Crucially, this translation must NOT be optimized for natural or idiomatic French.** Instead, it must strictly adhere to the following principles to maximize the visibility of structural and lexical parallels with the Italian:
        *   Follow the Italian word order as closely as possible, even if it sounds awkward in French.
        *   Use the most direct French cognate for Italian words whenever one exists (e.g., Italian `finestra` -> French `fenêtre`, Italian `importante` -> French `important`).
        *   Mirror Italian grammatical structures where feasible (e.g., if Italian uses a specific preposition + infinitive structure, try to replicate it in French, like `pensare a` -> `penser à`).
        *   Translate function words (prepositions, articles, conjunctions) literally (e.g., `nel` = `en le`/`dans le` before simplifying to `au`/`dans le`).
    *   The primary goal of this translation is *linguistic comparison*, not fluency or naturalness in French.
3.  **Add Comparative Notes:** Provide brief, focused notes comparing the Italian sentence and its literal French translation. These notes should highlight:
    *   Obvious cognates (words similar in spelling and meaning).
    *   Parallels in grammatical structures (e.g., tense usage like *Imperfetto* vs *Imparfait*, *Passato Prossimo* vs *Passé Composé*, reflexive verbs, passive voice construction).
    *   Similarities in phrasing or idiomatic expressions.
    *   Equivalences for key vocabulary or function words.
    *   *Optional:* Very brief mentions of minor, obvious structural differences if they aid understanding (e.g., different gender agreement rules, slightly different preposition usage).

**Frase 1**

1.  **Italiano Originale:** Nel 1946 uscì il suo secondo romanzo,L’isola dei condannati(De dömdas ö) e ricevette dal quotidiano di StoccolmaExpressenl’incarico di scrivere dalla Germania una serie di reportage sulle condizioni di quel paese dopo il crollo, reportage raccolti poi in volume e pubblicati l’anno successivo con il titoloAutunno tedesco(Tysk höst).
2.  **Francese Calque:** En le 1946 sortit le son second roman, L'île des condamnés (De dömdas ö) et reçut de le quotidien de Stockholm Expressen la charge d'écrire de la Germanie une série de reportages sur les conditions de quel pays après l'écroulement, reportages recueillis puis en volume et publiés l'an successif avec le titre Automne allemand (Tysk höst).
3.  **Note Comparative:**
    *   **Preposizioni Articolate:** `Nel` (in + il) diventa letteralmente `En le`. `Dal` (da + il) diventa `De le`. `Sulle` (su + le) diventa `Sur les`. La struttura è parallela, anche se il francese contrae `en le` in `en` davanti all'anno e `de le` in `du`.
    *   **Tempo Verbale:** I verbi italiani `uscì` e `ricevette` sono al *Passato Remoto*. Il calque usa il *Passé Simple* francese (`sortit`, `reçut`), che è l'equivalente storico/letterario diretto.
    *   **Possessivo:** `il suo` corrisponde a `le son`. L'ordine e la funzione sono identici.
    *   **Cognati Evidenti:** `secondo`/`second`, `romanzo`/`roman`, `isola`/`île`, `condannati`/`condamnés`, `quotidiano`/`quotidien`, `serie`/`série`, `reportage`/`reportage`, `condizioni`/`conditions`, `paese`/`pays` (quasi un cognato), `crollo`/`écroulement`, `volume`/`volume`, `pubblicati`/`publiés`, `anno`/`an`, `successivo`/`successif`, `titolo`/`titre`, `Autunno`/`Automne`.
    *   **Struttura Preposizione + Infinito:** `di scrivere` traduce direttamente `d'écrire`.
    *   **Struttura ""di + nome"" (genitivo/specificazione):** `dei condannati` (di + i) -> `des condamnés` (de + les); `di Stoccolma` -> `de Stockholm`; `di quel paese` -> `de quel pays`. Il meccanismo è simile.
    *   **Participi Passati Usati Come Aggettivi:** `raccolti` e `pubblicati` concordano con `reportage` (plurale maschile) in italiano. `recueillis` e `publiés` concordano con `reportages` (plurale maschile) in francese.
    *   **Vocabolario:** `incarico` può essere tradotto letteralmente come `charge`. `dalla Germania` -> `de la Germanie` (da + la / de + la). `poi` -> `puis`. `con` -> `avec`. `tedesco` si traduce con `allemand` (non un cognato).

**Frase 2**

1.  **Italiano Originale:** Sempre nel 1947, inoltre, pubblicò la raccolta di racconti I giochi della notte (Nattens lekar) e al Dramaten di Stoccolma venne rappresentato il suo dramma Il condannato a morte (Den dödsdömde).
2.  **Francese Calque:** Toujours en le 1947, en outre, publia la récolte de récits Les jeux de la nuit (Nattens lekar) et à le Dramaten de Stockholm fut représenté le son drame Le condamné à mort (Den dödsdömde).
3.  **Note Comparative:**
    *   **Avverbi:** `Sempre` corrisponde direttamente a `Toujours`. `Inoltre` corrisponde a `en outre`.
    *   **Preposizioni Articolate:** `nel` (in + il) -> `en le`. `al` (a + il) -> `à le` (il francese contrae in `au`). `della` (di + la) -> `de la`.
    *   **Tempo Verbale:** `pubblicò` (*Passato Remoto*) -> `publia` (*Passé Simple*).
    *   **Voce Passiva:** L'italiano usa l'ausiliare `venire` al *Passato Remoto* (`venne`) + participio passato (`rappresentato`). Il calque francese usa l'equivalente passivo con `être` al *Passé Simple* (`fut`) + participio passato (`représenté`). La struttura logica è parallela.
    *   **Cognati Evidenti:** `raccolta`/`récolte`, `racconti`/`récits`, `giochi`/`jeux`, `notte`/`nuit`, `rappresentato`/`représenté`, `dramma`/`drame`, `condannato`/`condamné`, `morte`/`mort`.
    *   **Possessivo:** `il suo` -> `le son`.
    *   **Struttura ""di + nome"":** `di racconti` -> `de récits`. `della notte` -> `de la nuit`. `di Stoccolma` -> `de Stockholm`.
    *   **Titoli:** La struttura dei titoli `I giochi della notte` / `Les jeux de la nuit` e `Il condannato a morte` / `Le condamné à mort` è identica.

**Frase 3**

1.  **Italiano Originale:** Nel 1948 pubblicò il romanzoBambino bruciato(Bränt barn) e nel 1949, come s’è detto, il suo ultimo libro,Le pene delle nozze..

    *   **Cognati Evidenti:** `romanzo`/`roman`, `bruciato`/`brûlé`, `ultimo`/`ultime`, `libro`/`livre`, `pene`/`peines`, `nozze`/`noces`. `Bambino` è molto vicino a `bambin` (colloquiale) ma si traduce standard con `enfant`.
    *   **Forma Impersonale/Passiva:** `come s’è detto` (forma riflessiva passivante, letteralmente `si è detto`, tempo *Passato Prossimo*) viene tradotta letteralmente come `comme se est dit`. Questa struttura esiste in francese (`cela s'est dit`), ma `comme on l'a dit` sarebbe più naturale.

","Bonjour ! Voici l'analyse détaillée du texte que vous m'avez soumis, suivie de la version corrigée.

---

**Analyse et corrections**

[**1 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...] qui a vraiment évolué dans les dernières années [...]
**Explication:** L'expression ""dans les dernières années"" est un calque de l'anglais (""in the last years""). En français, pour indiquer une évolution sur une période récente, on utilise plutôt ""au cours des dernières années"" ou ""ces dernières années"". L'adverbe ""vraiment"" peut être jugé un peu informel dans un contexte universitaire ; ""fortement"" ou ""considérablement"" seraient plus adaptés.
**Correction proposée:** [...] qui a considérablement évolué au cours des dernières années [...]

[**2 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...], spécialement avec l’arrivé [...]
**Explication:** L'adverbe ""spécialement"" est correct, mais ""notamment"" ou ""particulièrement"" sont souvent préférés dans ce type de contexte pour introduire un élément spécifique. De plus, le nom ""arrivée"" est féminin. Il faut donc écrire ""l'arrivée"".
**Correction proposée:** [...], notamment avec l’arrivée [...]

[**3 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...] de nouveaux résidents plus jeunes et professionels.
**Explication:** Il y a une faute d'orthographe dans l'adjectif ""professionnels"", qui prend deux ""n"".
**Correction proposée:** [...] de nouveaux résidents plus jeunes et professionnels.

[**4 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** Ce phénomène, qu’on appelle souvent la gentrification, a eu des impacts très importants [...]
**Explication:** L'expression ""a eu des impacts très importants"" est un peu lourde. On peut la rendre plus concise et élégante en utilisant ""a eu un impact majeur"" (si l'impact est global) ou ""a eu des conséquences importantes"".
**Correction proposée:** Ce phénomène, [...] a eu des conséquences importantes [...]

[**5 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...] les populations plus vulnérables qui se sont vues forcés de déménager [...]
**Explication:** Il y a une erreur d'accord. Le sujet implicite de ""forcés"" est ""les populations plus vulnérables"" (féminin pluriel). Le participe passé employé avec l'auxiliaire ""être"" dans la forme pronominale ""se voir"" s'accorde ici avec le sujet (qui est aussi le complément d'objet direct du verbe voir, placé avant). Il faut donc accorder ""vues"" et ""forcées"" au féminin pluriel.
**Correction proposée:** [...] les populations plus vulnérables qui se sont vues forcées de déménager [...]

[**6 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...] à cause de la hausse des prix de loyers.
**Explication:** L'expression ""prix de loyers"" est redondante. On parle simplement de ""la hausse des loyers"".
**Correction proposée:** [...] à cause de la hausse des loyers.

[**7 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** On peut clairement constater que le style de vie a changé pour plusieurs [...]
**Explication:** L'expression ""a changé pour plusieurs"" est un peu vague. On pourrait préciser ""pour plusieurs résidents"" ou utiliser une formulation plus formelle. L'utilisation de ""On"" peut être considérée comme informelle dans certains contextes académiques ; ""Il est clair"" ou ""On constate clairement"" sont des alternatives.
**Correction proposée:** On constate clairement que le mode de vie a changé pour plusieurs résidents [...]

[**8 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...] notamment les anciens résidents qui ont de la difficulté à s’adapter aux nouvelles réalités du quartier comme les cafés spécialisés et les boutiques chers.
**Explication:** La fin de la phrase, introduite par ""comme"", est un peu abrupte et liste des exemples de manière un peu maladroite. De plus, l'adjectif ""chers"" doit s'accorder avec ""boutiques"" (féminin pluriel) et devenir ""chères"".
**Correction proposée:** [...] notamment les anciens résidents qui peinent à s’adapter aux nouvelles réalités du quartier, telles que l’apparition de cafés spécialisés et de boutiques chères.

[**9 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** Cette dynamique crée un certain inconfort social, mais aussi des tensions qui sont pas toujours visibles [...]
**Explication:** Il manque l'adverbe de négation ""ne"" (ou ""n'"") avant le verbe dans la structure ""ne... pas"".
**Correction proposée:** [...] mais aussi des tensions qui ne sont pas toujours visibles [...]

[**10 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...], mais qui influencent quand même la cohésion.
**Explication:** L'expression ""quand même"" appartient à un registre de langue plutôt parlé ou informel. Dans un écrit universitaire, il est préférable d'utiliser des adverbes comme ""néanmoins"", ""toutefois"" ou ""cependant"".
**Correction proposée:** [...], mais qui influencent néanmoins la cohésion sociale. (Ajout de ""sociale"" pour la précision)

[**11 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** Il faut dire aussi que le quartier continue d’avoir des problèmes reliés à la pauvreté [...]
**Explication:** ""Il faut dire aussi que"" est une formulation un peu orale. ""Il convient également de noter que"" ou ""Par ailleurs, le quartier continue de faire face à"" seraient plus formels. ""Reliés à"" est correct, mais ""liés à"" est plus courant et légèrement plus formel.
**Correction proposée:** Par ailleurs, le quartier continue de faire face à des problèmes liés à la pauvreté [...]

[**12 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...] problèmes reliés à la pauvreté, la santé mentale, et la précarité [...]
**Explication:** La structure de l'énumération est correcte, mais l'emploi de la virgule avant ""et"" dans une énumération simple n'est généralement pas standard en français (contrairement à l'anglais, où la ""Oxford comma"" est parfois utilisée). Il suffit de lister les éléments séparés par des virgules, avec ""et"" avant le dernier.
**Correction proposée:** [...] problèmes liés à la pauvreté, à la santé mentale et à la précarité [...] (Ajout des prépositions ""à"" pour la clarté de la structure parallèle).

[**13 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...] même si on remarque aussi des améliorations du point de vue esthétique [...]
**Explication:** ""Du point de vue esthétique"" est un peu long. On peut utiliser directement l'adjectif : ""améliorations esthétiques"". L'adverbe ""aussi"" pourrait être redondant si l'on a déjà utilisé ""aussi"" ou ""également"" peu avant (cf. correction 11).
**Correction proposée:** [...] même si l'on remarque des améliorations esthétiques [...] (Utilisation de ""l'on"" après ""si"" pour éviter la cacophonie ""si on"").

[**14 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...], comme les nouvelles façades et les rénovations sur les rues principales.
**Explication:** L'expression ""rénovations sur les rues principales"" est imprécise. S'agit-il de la rénovation des bâtiments qui bordent ces rues ou de travaux sur la voirie elle-même ? On pourrait dire ""la rénovation des façades et les travaux effectués sur les rues principales"".
**Correction proposée:** [...], telles que la rénovation des façades et les travaux réalisés sur les rues principales.

[**15 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** En conclusion, bien que certains pensent que la transformation du quartier est positive [...]
**Explication:** La phrase est grammaticalement correcte, mais l'utilisation de ""certains pensent"" est un peu vague.
**Correction proposée:** En conclusion, bien que la transformation du quartier soit perçue positivement par certains [...] (Utilisation du subjonctif ""soit perçue"" après ""bien que"", et formulation plus formelle).

[**16 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** [...], d’autres réalisent que ça fait du tort à ceux qui habitaient là avant.
**Explication:** L'expression ""ça fait du tort"" est très informelle. Il faut utiliser une formulation plus neutre et académique comme ""cela nuit à"", ""cela porte préjudice à"" ou ""elle nuit à"" (en référence à ""la transformation"").
**Correction proposée:** [...], d’autres réalisent qu'elle nuit à ceux qui y résidaient auparavant. (Utilisation de ""elle"" pour ""la transformation"", ""y"" pour ""là"", et ""auparavant"" pour ""avant"").

[**17 de 17 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** Ensemble du texte.
**Explication:** Le texte utilise ""on"" à plusieurs reprises (""qu'on appelle"", ""on peut constater"", ""on remarque""). Si le contexte universitaire l'exige, il pourrait être remplacé par des tournures passives ou impersonnelles pour plus de formalité, mais son usage n'est pas incorrect en soi, surtout dans certaines disciplines. La correction finale conserve ""on"" pour rester proche du texte original, mais en améliorant la fluidité (""l'on"" après ""si""). Le texte manque parfois de mots de liaison pour assurer une meilleure cohésion entre les phrases.
**Correction proposée:** Intégration des corrections précédentes et ajustements mineurs pour la fluidité.

Il faut dire aussi que le quartier continue d’avoir des problèmes reliés à la pauvreté, la santé mentale, et la précarité, même si on remarque aussi des améliorations du point de vue esthétique, comme les nouvelles façades et les rénovations sur les rues principales. En conclusion, bien que certains pensent que la transformation du quartier est positive, d’autres réalisent que ça fait du tort à ceux qui habitaient là avant.

","Bonjour,

Voici l'analyse du texte que vous avez soumis, suivie d'une proposition de correction. J'ai relevé 15 points qui méritent attention, allant de l'orthographe à des questions de style et d'usage.

---

[**1 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** dans les dernières années
**Explication:** Bien que compréhensible, l'expression ""dans les dernières années"" est moins idiomatique en français que ""au cours des dernières années"" ou ""ces dernières années"" pour indiquer une période récente et continue.
**Correction proposée:** au cours des dernières années (ou : ces dernières années)

[**2 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** spécialement
**Explication:** L'adverbe ""spécialement"" est correct, mais dans ce contexte, ""particulièrement"" ou ""notamment"" sont souvent préférés pour souligner un élément spécifique parmi d'autres.
**Correction proposée:** particulièrement (ou : notamment)

[**3 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** l’arrivé
**Explication:** Le mot ""arrivée"" est un nom féminin dérivé du verbe ""arriver"". Il doit donc s'écrire avec un ""e"" final.
**Correction proposée:** l'arrivée

[**4 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** professionels
**Explication:** Erreur d'orthographe. L'adjectif ""professionnel"" prend deux ""n"". Au masculin pluriel, il s'écrit ""professionnels"".
**Correction proposée:** professionnels

[**5 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** qui se sont vues forcés
**Explication:** Problème d'accord du participe passé avec le verbe pronominal ""se voir"". Le pronom réfléchi ""se"" (mis pour ""les populations plus vulnérables"") est le complément d'objet direct (COD) et il est placé avant l'auxiliaire ""être"". Le participe passé ""vu"" s'accorde donc avec ce COD (""populations"", féminin pluriel) : ""vues"". De même, l'adjectif ""forcé"" doit s'accorder avec le sujet implicite (""les populations"") ou le COD (""se"") qu'il qualifie : ""forcées"".
**Correction proposée:** qui se sont vues forcées

[**6 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** à cause de la hausse des prix de loyers
**Explication:** Il manque un article défini devant ""loyers"". On parle de la hausse *du prix des* loyers (le prix général des loyers) ou *des prix des* loyers (si l'on considère qu'il y a plusieurs types de prix). ""En raison de"" est également une locution un peu plus formelle que ""à cause de"".
**Correction proposée:** en raison de la hausse du prix des loyers (ou : en raison de la hausse des prix des loyers)

[**7 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** le style de vie
**Explication:** Bien que ""style de vie"" soit compris, le terme ""mode de vie"" est plus couramment utilisé en français pour parler de la manière générale de vivre d'une personne ou d'un groupe.
**Correction proposée:** le mode de vie

[**8 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** les boutiques chers
**Explication:** Problème d'accord de l'adjectif qualificatif. L'adjectif ""cher"" doit s'accorder en genre et en nombre avec le nom qu'il qualifie, ""boutiques"" (féminin pluriel).
**Correction proposée:** les boutiques chères

[**9 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** qui sont pas toujours visibles
**Explication:** Oubli de l'adverbe de négation ""ne"" qui est obligatoire dans la structure ""ne... pas"" en français standard.
**Correction proposée:** qui ne sont pas toujours visibles

[**10 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** la cohésion
**Explication:** Le terme ""cohésion"" est un peu vague ici. Préciser ""cohésion sociale"" rend l'idée plus claire dans ce contexte sociologique. ""Quand même"" peut être remplacé par ""néanmoins"" pour un registre plus soutenu.
**Correction proposée:** la cohésion sociale (et ""influencent néanmoins"" au lieu de ""influencent quand même"")

[**11 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** problèmes reliés à
**Explication:** Erreur d'orthographe. Le participe passé du verbe ""relier"" utilisé comme adjectif est ""relié"", mais ici, il s'agit de ""lier"" (to link). Le participe passé correct est ""liés"". De plus, ""être confronté à des problèmes"" est une formulation plus précise que ""avoir des problèmes"".
**Correction proposée:** problèmes liés à (ou : continue d'être confronté à des problèmes liés à)

[**12 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** la pauvreté, la santé mentale, et la précarité
**Explication:** En français, on n'utilise généralement pas de virgule avant ""et"" dans une énumération simple, sauf si elle est nécessaire pour éviter une ambiguïté, ce qui n'est pas le cas ici. Aussi, ""la santé mentale"" seul peut être ambigu; on parle souvent des ""problèmes de santé mentale"".
**Correction proposée:** la pauvreté, les problèmes de santé mentale et la précarité

[**13 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** du point de vue esthétique
**Explication:** L'expression est correcte, mais ""sur le plan esthétique"" est une alternative courante et parfois jugée plus élégante ou concise.
**Correction proposée:** sur le plan esthétique

[**14 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** les rénovations sur les rues principales
**Explication:** La préposition ""sur"" n'est pas la plus adaptée ici. On effectue des rénovations ""des"" rues (ou ""dans"" les rues, mais ""des"" est plus naturel pour indiquer l'objet de la rénovation).
**Correction proposée:** les rénovations des rues principales

[**15 de 15 corrections**]
**Segment problématique:** ça fait du tort à ceux qui habitaient là avant.
**Explication:** L'expression ""ça fait du tort"" appartient à un registre de langue plus familier. Dans un texte universitaire, il est préférable d'utiliser des termes comme ""nuit à"", ""porte préjudice à"" ou ""est préjudiciable pour"". De même, ""ceux qui habitaient là avant"" peut être remplacé par une formulation plus concise ou formelle comme ""ses habitants précédents"" ou ""ceux qui y résidaient auparavant"".
**Correction proposée:** elle nuit à ceux qui y résidaient auparavant (ou : elle porte préjudice à ses habitants précédents)

**Texte corrigé:**

Hochelaga est un quartier qui a vraiment évolué au cours des dernières années, particulièrement avec l'arrivée de nouveaux résidents plus jeunes et professionnels. Ce phénomène, souvent appelé gentrification, a eu des conséquences importantes sur le tissu social du quartier, notamment en ce qui concerne les populations plus vulnérables qui se sont vues forcées de déménager en raison de la hausse du prix des loyers. On constate clairement que le mode de vie a changé pour beaucoup, notamment pour les anciens résidents qui éprouvent des difficultés à s'adapter aux nouvelles réalités du quartier, comme les cafés spécialisés et les boutiques chères. Cette dynamique crée un certain inconfort social, mais aussi des tensions qui ne sont pas toujours visibles, mais qui influencent néanmoins la cohésion sociale. Il convient également de noter que le quartier continue d'être confronté à des problèmes liés à la pauvreté, aux problèmes de santé mentale et à la précarité, bien que l'on remarque aussi des améliorations sur le plan esthétique, comme les nouvelles façades et les rénovations des rues principales. En conclusion, bien que certains considèrent la transformation du quartier comme positive, d'autres réalisent qu'elle nuit à ceux qui y résidaient auparavant.",search

In the same way, the ultrasonic cries of bats and dolphins fall into this same eerie void, drift through the world unheard; they are beyond the reach of human ears.","Here are a few options, playing with different facets of a bestselling author's style:

**Option 1 (Evocative & Philosophical):**

> Though the blackbird may seem to flood the air with its captivating song, the bird itself dwells in silence. What we perceive as melody begins as mere disturbance – invisible ripples spreading through the atmosphere, waves of pressure pulsing outwards. They are nothing but physics until they encounter an ear, journeying inward to the astonishing alchemy of the brain. It is *there*, within our own minds, that these raw vibrations are transmuted into the music that stirs us. Remove the listener, and the concert dissolves. The pressure shifts fade back into the void, voiceless, meaningless, unheard. In that same profound quiet drift the ultrasonic calls of bats slicing through the dusk, the intricate clicks of dolphins charting the deep. They echo through our world, entirely real, yet forever beyond the grasp of our senses – phantoms of pressure in an eerie, silent ballet we can only imagine.

**Option 2 (Intimate & Wonder-Filled):**

> Listen closely to the blackbird's song, a performance that can steal your breath. Yet, the truth is quieter, stranger: the bird itself is silent. The sound you cherish exists only *for* you, *within* you. Out there, it's just ripples in the air, waves of pressure traveling outwards. Your brain, a masterful interpreter, catches these subtle shifts and weaves them into melody. Without you, the listener, those waves simply dissipate, carrying no voice, no meaning, fading into nothingness. It makes you wonder, doesn't it? Think of the sounds we *never* hear – the high-frequency cries of bats hunting by moonlight, the complex sonar language of dolphins in the ocean's dark. They are real, those vibrations are traveling through our world right now, yet they fall into the same deep well of silence, forever beyond the reach of our human ears.

**Option 3 (Concise & Punchy):**

> The blackbird sings, captivatingly. But the bird? Utterly silent. Sound isn't *out there*; it's *in here*. What travels through the air are mere pressure waves, longitudinal ripples. It's the alchemy inside our skulls that transforms this raw physics into melody. No listener? No song. Just meaningless pressure shifts dissolving into quiet. By this same token, the ultrasonic screams of bats and the sonar clicks of dolphins pierce the world completely unheard by us. They exist, ripples in the air like any other, but fall into an eerie void – real, yet silent, beyond the limits of our ears.",search

In the same way, the ultrasonic cries of bats and dolphins fall into this same eerie void, drift through the world unheard; they are beyond the reach of human ears.","Here are a few options, playing with slightly different tones a bestselling author might use:

**Option 1 (Slightly Poetic & Philosophical):**

> That blackbird, enthralling on its branch, sings only silence. The song itself? That masterpiece blooms entirely within the listener's mind. Out there, in the world, there are only vibrations – subtle ripples cascading through the air, mere shifts in pressure. It is our own brain, the astonishing alchemist, that transforms these raw disturbances into the rich tapestry of melody. Take away the listener, and the world falls mute. Those airborne tremors dissipate into nothingness, devoid of voice, stripped of meaning. So too, the sounds beyond our grasp – the ultrasonic shriek of a bat, the intricate clicks of a dolphin – they pulse through the vast, indifferent air, existing in that same profound silence, forever unheard by human ears.

**Option 2 (More Direct & Intriguing):**

> Despite its captivating show, the blackbird makes no sound. Not really. The music you hear is an invention, crafted solely inside your head. What travels through the air are merely pressure waves, invisible ripples. Your brain intercepts these physical nudges and, like a magician, conjures melody from them. Without an ear and a mind to receive them, those waves are just… waves. Silent, meaningless disturbances. It’s a stark reminder that whole worlds of sound exist beyond us – the high-frequency cries of bats, the sonar clicks of dolphins – slicing through the air, utterly real, yet drifting through our reality unheard, lost in the great, silent void beyond our senses.

**Option 3 (Focus on the ""Alchemy"" Metaphor):**

> The blackbird’s performance can steal your breath, yet the bird itself remains profoundly silent. The sound is an illusion, a phantom conjured by perception. What truly exists are physical ripples in the atmosphere, longitudinal waves pushing through the air. Our brains are the alchemists here, taking these base vibrations and transmuting them into the gold of melody. Strip away the audience – the ear, the mind – and those pressure shifts collapse back into raw physics, voiceless and without significance. This hidden reality extends further: imagine the ultrasonic cries of bats hunting insects, the complex clicks of dolphins echoing in the depths. They are real, physical events slicing through the world, yet for us, they fall into that same eerie silence, unheard vibrations in a frequency we cannot access.

**Key changes made across options:**

*   **Stronger Verbs:** ""Blooms,"" ""cascading,"" ""conjures,"" ""transmuting,"" ""dissipate,"" ""slicing,"" ""pulse.""
*   **More Evocative Language:** ""Enthralling,"" ""masterpiece,"" ""astonishing alchemist,"" ""rich tapestry,"" ""profound silence,"" ""great, silent void,"" ""phantom conjured by perception.""

64,"Rewrite with the clarity of a bestselling author: When someone stands close to a source of commotion, the air itself seems to throb with urgency. Waves of kinetic energy surge outward, like ocean swells crashing against a cliff. These intensified vibrations slam into the eardrums, making them quiver with force and triggering a surge of electrical activity deep within the inner ear. The brain seizes these signals, charged with raw energy,  translating them into the unmistakable sensation of loudness., helping the person gauge the distance of the disturbance.

","Here are a few options, playing with slightly different tones, in the style of a bestselling author:

**Option 1 (Focus on visceral experience):**

> Stand close to the heart of the commotion, and the very air changes. It grows thick, palpable, buzzing against your skin with an urgent energy. Invisible waves of force—raw kinetic energy made tangible—radiate outwards, crashing against you like unseen ocean breakers. These aren't gentle ripples; they strike the delicate membrane of your eardrum with physical impact, forcing it to shudder. Deep within the intricate pathways of the inner ear, this assault triggers a flood of electrical signals. Your brain intercepts this potent data, instantly translating the raw power into the visceral, overwhelming sensation of *loudness* – a primal measure of just how near the disturbance truly lies.

**Option 2 (Slightly more scientific, but still evocative):**

> Approach the epicenter of any disturbance, and you feel it before you truly hear it. The air itself seems to pulse, vibrating with contained power. Waves of kinetic energy surge from the source, not like gentle swells, but like focused pressure fronts. When these intensified vibrations strike the eardrum, they hit with force, compelling the tiny membrane to quiver violently. This physical shock ignites a storm of electrical activity in the labyrinth of the inner ear. The brain, ever vigilant, seizes this raw, energetic input, instantly decoding it as the unmistakable signature of loudness—a crucial clue, delivered by physics itself, revealing the proximity of the source.

**Option 3 (More concise and punchy):**

> Get close enough to chaos, and the air itself feels alive, thrumming with a physical urgency. Waves of energy pound outwards, invisible but undeniable, like shockwaves against your body. They slam into your eardrums, making them tremble with the sheer force of the impact. This violence triggers an electrical cascade deep inside your head. Your brain receives this raw energy signature and translates it instantly: *Loud*. And in that loudness, there's an instinctive calculation – the greater the intensity, the nearer the source.

70,"Rewrite with the clarity of a bestselling author: The gustatory system depends on subjective perceptions to express its effects. In reality, sweetness is not a natural property of sugars, and the aversion to spoiled foods is simply a perceived illusion. Take white sugar, for example, which is made up of 12 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, and 11 oxygen atoms. A single carbon atom has no taste, and adding more hydrogen atoms doesn't change that. Sweetness is a feeling created in the brain, which motivates organisms to seek sugars for their own good. Without this perception, a caregiver of a tasteless organism would struggle to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy foods and would need a solid understanding of chemistry and the human body’s workings.","Here are a few options, playing with different tones a bestselling author might adopt:

**Option 1 (Evocative & Philosophical):**

> Taste, that intimate explosion of pleasure or disgust on our tongues, feels utterly real. Yet, the entire gustatory system operates on a grand deception, orchestrated by our own minds. Consider sweetness: we imagine it locked intrinsically within a sugar crystal, a tangible quality like its whiteness or texture. But reality is far less intuitive. Sugar, chemically, is merely a scaffold of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁). A single carbon atom offers no taste; adding hydrogen changes nothing. Sweetness, therefore, isn't *in* the sugar; it's a phantom sensation, a brilliantly crafted *feeling* generated by the brain. It’s an evolutionary siren song, luring us towards vital energy sources. Likewise, the revulsion we feel towards spoiled food isn't inherent in the rot itself, but a life-saving *illusion* of danger. Strip away these subjective perceptions, and the world becomes bafflingly neutral. Imagine caring for someone unable to taste: distinguishing nourishing food from poison would transform from instinct into a complex, perilous chemistry lesson, demanding intimate knowledge of molecular structures and metabolic needs just to survive a simple meal.

**Option 2 (Direct & Intriguing):**

> Think the sweetness of sugar is real? Think again. Our sense of taste is built on powerful, necessary illusions. Sweetness isn't a property inherent in sugars, any more than the danger we perceive is truly *in* spoiled food. Look at basic white sugar – it’s just 12 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen, and 11 oxygen. None of these atoms taste sweet alone, and bundling them together doesn't magically imbue the molecule with inherent flavour. What we call ""sweetness"" is actually a neurological event, a perception manufactured entirely within the brain. It's a clever biological bribe, motivating us to seek out the sugars our bodies need. Without this internal reward system – and its counterpart, the aversion signal for harmful decay – how would we navigate the world? Feeding ourselves, or our young, would become a high-stakes chemical analysis, requiring a profound grasp of biology and chemistry simply to tell lunch from poison. Taste isn't just perception; it's our brain's essential, life-sustaining interpretation of chemistry.

**Option 3 (Storytelling Focus):**

> Our relationship with food begins with a lie – a beautiful, necessary lie told by our brains. The delight of sweetness, the warning tang of sourness, the gag reflex from rot – these feel like fundamental truths about the world, properties embedded directly in what we eat. But they are not. Sweetness, for example, doesn't truly exist within the sugar molecule itself. That familiar white crystal is just a precise arrangement of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁). Taste one carbon atom? Nothing. Add hydrogen? Still nothing. Sweetness is the *brain's* invention, a subjective experience designed to drive us towards energy. It’s a reward signal, not an objective quality. The same holds true for our aversion to spoilage; it's a brain-generated alarm, not a feature of the decay. Imagine a world devoid of these perceptions. A parent trying to nourish a child who tastes nothing would face an impossible task, needing the skills of a biochemist to decipher which substances offer life and which threaten it. Taste, then, isn't a window onto the chemical reality of food, but a brilliantly evolved, subjective map *essential* for navigating it.",search

Yet, they are elegant illusions, conjured not by the food, but by our own brains. Take simple white sugar: it's merely a precise arrangement of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁). Does a single carbon atom taste sweet? Of course not. Pile on hydrogen and oxygen – does sweetness magically appear? No. The molecule itself possesses no inherent 'sweet' quality. Sweetness is a *perception*, a neurological reward system designed to drive us toward energy-rich foods vital for survival. Our aversion to rot works the same way – a primal 'Danger!' signal triggered by decay. Without this built-in guidance system, imagine trying to nourish someone completely devoid of taste. You'd need a deep understanding of chemistry and biology just to distinguish life-sustaining fuel from lethal poison, a task our 'illusory' senses handle instinctively every single day.

**Option 2 (More Conversational & Metaphorical):**

> Taste feels so real, doesn't it? That delightful sweetness, that warning tang of food gone bad – surely those are qualities *in* the food? Not quite. Our sense of taste is less a window onto reality and more a clever interpretation painted by our brains. Consider table sugar, chemically just carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁). An atom of carbon is tasteless. So are hydrogen and oxygen. Stick them together in a specific way, and *poof*? No, the molecule itself isn't inherently sweet. Sweetness is the brain's *reaction* to it – a biological bribe saying, ""Yes! Eat this! It's fuel!"" Likewise, the disgust for spoiled food isn't the food's fault; it's our brain screaming ""Avoid! Toxin!"" based on chemical cues. Strip away this perception, and feeding someone becomes a terrifyingly complex chemistry problem. How would a caregiver know good fuel from bad without the effortless guide of pleasure and revulsion? They'd need a scientist's knowledge just to manage a meal, a burden our brilliant, deceptive senses lift entirely.

**Option 3 (Concise & Punchy):**

> We trust our taste buds implicitly, but they deal in sophisticated lies. Sweetness isn't actually *in* sugar, any more than 'danger' is physically woven into the scent of decay. These are perceptions, survival tools crafted by the brain. Look at sugar: it's just carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁), none of which taste sweet alone or combined. The molecule itself is flavorless. Sweetness is the *feeling* the brain generates to reward us for finding energy. The revulsion from spoiled food? That's the brain's alarm bell, not an intrinsic property of rot. Imagine feeding someone who couldn't taste. Without the shortcuts of pleasure and disgust, you’d need an expert grasp of biochemistry to tell nutritious calories from deadly contaminants at every meal. Taste, this neurological magic trick, makes survival intuitive.

76,"please make outline for me to make mind map from this text: Agents to Decrease the Metabolic Activity of the Brain 
If ICP remains poorly controlled despite all of the efforts described above, then induced pharmacological coma may be considered. The proposed mechanism by which pharmacological coma lowers ICP is through reduction of cerebral metabolism, measured by the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, with concomitant reductions in cerebral blood flow and reduced cerebral tissue oxygen demand. The most common agent used for pharmacological coma is pentobarbital. This drug can be administered intravenously at a loading dose of 5 mg/kg, followed by an infusion of 1 to 3 mg/kg/h. A “high-dose” regimen begins with an IV loading dose of 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes followed by a 5 mg/kg/h infusion for 3 hours, followed by 1 mg/kg/h titrated to therapeutic goals, which are either burst suppression on continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring or reduction in ICP.47 If burst suppression is not obtained with this dose, then another smaller bolus loading dose and increased rate can be given until a satisfactory EEG tracing is seen or ICP is controlled. Additional loading doses must be part of any increase in barbiturate therapy, because merely increasing the continuous infusion rate without a bolus will not affect ICP, EEG results, or serum levels of pentobarbital for some time. Other barbiturates may be used, including the much shorter acting thiopental, whose half-life of 5 hours is suited for short-term therapy of elevations in ICP.54 Thiopental doses of 200 to 500 mg can be given via IV bolus, but the patient must undergo close monitoring for hypotension. Use of medications of this class are reserved for patients with an established airway. Recent geopolitical tensions have severely limited the domestic supply and availability of thiopental because of its off-label use in the United States by state corrections institutions as part of lethal injection procedures.61 
Another option for pharmacological coma is propofol, which is given at an IV loading dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by a titrated infusion of up to 100 to 150 μg/kg/min. The use of propofol for this clinical indication is controversial. In terms of efficacy, a study using propofol for ICP reduction showed a failure of an improvement in 6-month outcome.62 Long-term and high-dose propofol infusions have been associated with the development of propofol infusion syndrome, which consists of renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, myocardial failure, metabolic acidosis, and death. The mechanism for this is not fully understood, but significant caution must be used in administering any infusion greater than 5 mg/kg/h, particularly for treatment lasting longer than 48 hours.8 If propofol or barbiturates are used, then continuous EEG monitoring
should be performed as the therapeutic goal will be either burst-suppression on EEG or desired degree of ICP control. 
","Okay, here is an outline based on the provided text, designed to help you create a mind map about agents used to decrease the brain's metabolic activity for managing Intracranial Pressure (ICP).

**Central Topic: Agents to Decrease Brain Metabolic Activity (for ICP Control)**

1.  **Pharmacological Coma (Induced)**
    *   **Purpose/Indication:**
        *   Used when ICP remains poorly controlled despite other efforts.
    *   **Proposed Mechanism:**
        *   Reduces cerebral metabolism (measured by cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen).
        *   Leads to concomitant reductions in cerebral blood flow.
        *   Reduces cerebral tissue oxygen demand.
    *   **General Monitoring for Propofol/Barbiturates:**
        *   Continuous Electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring.
        *   Therapeutic Goals:
            *   Burst suppression on EEG.
            *   Desired degree of ICP control.

2.  **Types of Agents:**

    *   **A. Pentobarbital (Most Common Barbiturate)**
        *   **Administration:** Intravenous (IV).
        *   **Dosage Regimens:**
            *   **Standard:**
                *   Loading dose: 5 mg/kg.
                *   Infusion: 1 to 3 mg/kg/h.
            *   **""High-dose"":**
                *   Loading dose: 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes.
                *   Followed by: 5 mg/kg/h infusion for 3 hours.
                *   Then: 1 mg/kg/h titrated to therapeutic goals.
        *   **Titration Goals:**
            *   Burst suppression on continuous EEG.
            *   Reduction in ICP.
        *   **Important Considerations:**
            *   If burst suppression not obtained, another smaller bolus and increased rate can be given.
            *   Additional loading doses are crucial when increasing barbiturate therapy (merely increasing infusion rate is insufficient initially).

    *   **B. Thiopental (Other Barbiturate)**

        *   **Dosage:** 200 to 500 mg.
        *   **Critical Monitoring:** Close monitoring for hypotension.
        *   **Prerequisite:** Patient must have an established airway.
        *   **Availability Issue:**
            *   Severely limited domestic supply (US).
            *   Reason: Off-label use in lethal injection procedures by state corrections institutions.

    *   **C. Propofol**
        *   **Administration:** Intravenous (IV).
        *   **Dosage:**

        *   **Efficacy for ICP Reduction:**
            *   Controversial.
            *   One study showed no improvement in 6-month outcome.
        *   **Risks/Concerns:**
            *   **Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PIS):**
                *   Associated with: Long-term and high-dose infusions.
                *   Manifestations:
                    *   Renal failure.
                    *   Rhabdomyolysis.
                    *   Hyperkalemia.

                *   Mechanism: Not fully understood.
            *   **Caution Advised:**
                *   With infusions > 5 mg/kg/h.
                *   Particularly for treatment lasting > 48 hours.
